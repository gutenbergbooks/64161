<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> these little sketches of a few out of the
innumerable multitude of ways in which the sea
has spoken to me during my long acquaintance
with it, I have tried with ’prentice hand to reproduce
for shore-dwellers some of the things it
has told me. If I were to stop and consider what
other men, freeholders upon the upper slopes of
the literary Olympus, have done in the same
direction, I should not dare to put forth this
little book.</p>

<p>Let my plea be that I have not seen with their
eyes nor heard with their ears, but with mine own.
This may have some weight with my judges—those
who will buy the wares I have to sell.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Mr. Bullen’s</span> work in literature requires no
introduction. If it ever did, it has received one
so complete from Mr. Kipling, that not another
word is needed. Mr. Kipling, in phrases as happy
as they are generous, has exactly described the
character of Mr. Bullen’s writings. After that,
to commend him to the public is superfluous.
However, in spite of this, Mr. Bullen has asked
me to write a few words to put in the front of
his book, and I obey. If my introduction does
no good, it will at least do no harm, and I shall at
any rate have the pleasure of being in very good
company. His whales and sharks and other
monsters of the deep are creatures with whom
one is proud to be associated.</p>

<p>These Idylls—little pictures—strike me as some
of the most vivid things ever written about the
sea. I take it that only a man who has used the
sea as a common sailor, and before the mast, really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
knows it in all its humours,—has heard all those
multitudinous voices that echo along the vast
waste spaces of the deep. The officer is either too
busy with his responsibilities of command, or else
is off duty and so not at close quarters with the
winds and waves. As a rule the sailor,—the
man who heaves the lead, stands at the wheel,
sits in the crow’s nest for long hours together,
and does the more wearisome and leisurely duties
of the ship, is not a person of sufficient imagination
and education to record the impressions that
come to those who do battle with “a remote and
unhearing Ocean.” In Mr. Bullen, perhaps for
the first time, we have a man who has been a
fo’c’s’le hand and yet has the power, first to realise
in a literary shape, and then to set down, the
wonders of the flood. It was a most happy combination
that for once the man who saw the tropic
dawn from the crow’s nest of a whaler should be
able to communicate the full magic of the scene.</p>

<p>It is not conventionally that I have called Mr.
Bullen’s work “vivid.” It is of writing such as
his that we can say, and say truly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I watch no longer—I myself am there.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">He transports us to the very place he describes—does
not merely hand us a stereoscopic glass in
which to observe a well-defined photograph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span></p>

<p>One other quality has always struck me in Mr.
Bullen’s work. In spite of the fact that he knows
so much science, and makes so keen and convincing
a use of this knowledge, there is always an
air of mystery and enchantment about his writing.
De Quincey’s brother told De Quincey that all
his arguments against the supernatural were
perfectly sound here in England, but that they
did not hold “to the suth’ard of the line.” In
the Southern Seas were still to be found realms
where pure reason was not supreme. But Mr.
Bullen’s experiences and Idylls are “to the suth’ard
of the line.” He deals as a rule with that region
of romance, and hence it is, I suppose, that a sense
of something strange and fateful, and so fascinating,
haunts his pictures of the sea.</p>

<p>But I am doing the readers of this book a very
ill turn in keeping them waiting at the door. Let
them be assured that there is matter well worth
their marking within, and that if they are capable
of taking pleasure in the sea and its secrets, they
cannot fail of entertainment here.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE PASSING OF PETER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">For</span> six weeks we had simmered in unwinking
sunblaze by day, and by night had stared with
ever-fresh wonder at the blue-black immensity
above, bejewelled with stars as the sand on the
sea-shore for multitude. Among the glorious
host of heaven the dazzling moon sailed on her
stately way, the radiant splendour of her rays
almost unbearable in their penetrating power.
Beneath us the waveless ocean lay like another
sky, its levelled surface unruffled by the faintest
zephyr. On moonless nights it was often hard
to divest oneself of the idea that we were floating
in mid-air, so little difference was there between
below and above. Our passage, already over
long, seemed to have ended here, a thousand
miles from land, and far out of the track of other
ships. For some time this wondrous restfulness
of all the elements fell upon our souls like the
soothing touch of a mother’s hand upon the
fevered head of her child. In the night watches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
voices were hushed, and whispered converse
came gently from lips unaccustomed to such
topics, upon subjects exalted and solemn. Even
during the day, while engaged in severe toil—for
our careful captain was utilising this unwelcome
opportunity in a general refit—it seemed as if all
hands were under a deep impression of gravity,
as though conscious of contact with the eternities.
But this feeling of awe, which was almost involuntary
worship, gradually gave place as the
days passed in changeless procession to an
increasing sense of indefinite fear. Each man
looked askance at his fellow’s face, fearfully seeking
sight of that shadow he felt upon his own. One
unspoken question trembled on every lip, one
overmastering idea blended with and tinctured
all others. A change, unusual as unwholesome,
came over the bright blue of the sea. No longer
did it reflect, as in a limpid mirror, the splendour
of the sun, the sweet silvery glow of the moon,
or the coruscating clusters of countless stars.
Like the ashen-grey hue that bedims the countenance
of the dying, a filmy greasy skin appeared to
overspread the recent loveliness of the ocean’s
surface. The sea was sick, stagnant, and foul.
From its turbid waters arose a miasmatic vapour
like a breath of decay, which clung clammily to
the palate and dulled all the senses. Drawn by
some strange force from the unfathomable depths
below, eerie shapes sought the surface, blinking
glassily at the unfamiliar glare they had exchanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
for their native gloom,—uncouth creatures bedight
with tasselled fringes like weed-growths waving
around them, fathom-long medusæ with coloured
spots like eyes clustering all over their transparent
substance, wriggling worm-like forms of such
elusive matter that the smallest exposure to the
sun melted them, and they were not. Lower
down, vast pale shadows crept sluggishly along,
happily undistinguishable as yet, but adding a
half-familiar flavour to the strange, faint smell
that hung about us. Of the ordinary fish which
attend a vessel under healthful conditions few
were to be seen. Such stragglers as occasionally
came near were languid and purposeless in their
movements, as if infected by the universal <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">malaise</i>
that only fostered foul and fermenting growths.
The sole exceptions were the sharks, who came
and went as stealthily, but as eagerly as ever.</p>

<p>Such a morbific, unwholesome condition of
our environment as this utter cessation of the
revivifying motion of the aerial ocean, with its
beneficent reaction upon the watery world beneath,
could not fail sooner or later to affect
the health of the crew. Doubtless the heavy
toil in which all hands were continually engaged
during the day put off the coming disaster longer
than would otherwise have been the case. But
the ship was ill found, the meat was partially
decayed, and the bread honeycombed by various
vermin. The water alone was comparatively
sweet, although somewhat flavoured with tar, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
we had caught it as it fell from the surcharged
skies. There was no change of dietary, no fresh
provisions, except when, as a great banquet once
in two months, an allowance of soup and bouilli
was served out, which only suggested a change,
hardly supplied it. Men grew listless and uncompanionable.
Each aloof from his fellows
took to hanging moodily over the bulwarks and
staring steadfastly at the unpleasant surface of the
once beautiful sea. And the livid impalpabilities
that, gigantic and gruesome, pursued their shadowy,
stealthy glidings beneath seemed to be daily
growing more definite and terrible. The watchers
glared at them until their overburdened imagination
could support the sight no longer, and they sought
relief by hoarse cries from the undefinable terror.
One by one the seamen fell sick, apparently
with scurvy, that most loathsome ailment, that
seems to combine in itself half a dozen other
diseases and reproduces old and long-forgotten
wounds. It was accompanied, too, by partial
blindness, as of moon-stroke, rendering the
sufferers utterly unable to see anything at night,
even though by day their sight was still fairly
good. Already short-handed, this new distress
added greatly to the physical sufferings of the
patient mariners, who endured with a fortitude
seldom seen among merchant seamen the slowly
accumulating burden of their sorrows. The
questioning look before noted as visible in every
man’s eyes now took another meaning. As a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
recent and a most powerful writer, Joseph Conrad,
has noticed, one of the strongest superstitions
current among seamen is the notion that such an
abnormal condition of the elements calls for a
human victim. Life must be paid that the
majority may live. Whose would it be? No
word was spoken on the subject, but the sequel
showed how deeply seated was the idea.</p>

<p>At last from among the brooding men one
figure detached itself and became prominent with
an unearthly significance. He was an old and
feeble man named Peter Burn, unfitted in any case
to endure much longer the ordinary stress of a
sailor’s life. But suddenly his frailty seemed to
obtrude itself persistently upon our notice until his
worn-out frame became almost transparent. Towards
the close of this moribund state of the
elements Peter’s mind grew retrospective. His
present surroundings seemed to fade from his
knowledge, becoming, as far as he was concerned,
non-existent. Hour after hour he would lie
yarning incessantly of bygone exploits in long-forgotten
ships on many seas. In the long, quiet
evenings all hands that were able would gather
round with pipes aglow and listen silently to his
babbling, flowing like a placid stream of sound,
contrasting curiously with the lurid language in
which he revived the scenes of riot, bloodshed, and
license of his distant youth. He still relished a
pipe, although he hardly seemed aware whether it
was alight or not. But there was always some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
ready to catch it as it fell from his trembling jaws,
or to support it tenderly with one hand while a
light was applied with the other. Day by day his
detachment from present things increased. He
lived only in the misty past, his immediate environment
became a perfect blank, and he called
his shipmates by strange names. Of any want of
the consolations of religion he manifested no sign,
and as there was none to offer them, the pathos of
that dreadful indifference passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>At last, one evening, when a sticky haze rose
sluggishly from the fermenting sea, peopling the
immediate vicinity of the ship with fantastic shapes,
Peter raised his voice in an astonishing volume of
sound, commanding his attendants to carry him on
deck. They instantly obeyed. Very tenderly and
cautiously they bore him to the top-gallant forecastle,
whence a clear view could be obtained all
around. Through the hedge of mist the moon
was rising, a vast blood-red disc, across the face
of which passed in weird procession formless
phantoms of indefinite and ever-varying suggestiveness.
Overhead, the lustreless stars looked down
wearily out of a sky that had paled from its deep
azure to a neutral tint of green. From beneath,
the foul effluvia ascended like the air of a charnel-house.
Even the gleaming phosphorescence in the
wake of the living things below glared pale and
slow. The heavy silence around was only broken
at long intervals by the melancholy wail of a weary
sea-bird that feared to rest on the glairy sea. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
board the voice of our ancient shipmate prattled on
in tones scarcely human and in language unintelligible
to any of us. As the moon, rising
clear of the steaming vapours, resumed her normal
appearance, she shot a pallid beam across us where,
like a group of ghosts, we crouched around Peter’s
prone form. When the cold ray touched his face
it suddenly changed, and became beautiful, but
only for a moment. Then the withered, toothless
jaw dropped, the dim eyeballs settled in their
sockets, and Peter passed from among us. Like a
voice from heaven came the command, breaking
the heavy stillness, “Square away the main-yard.”
As men in a dream we obeyed. But the sweet
breeze aroused us as it swept away the fœtid mist
in reluctant rolls and eddies. A joyful sound like
the musical murmur of a brooklet arose from
beneath the forefoot as the good ship resumed her
long-hindered journey through the reviving sea,
and the long calm was over.</p>

<p>Then when sail had been trimmed, and gear
coiled up again, came the sailmaker softly, a roll
of worn canvas under his arm, and his palm and
needle ready. In ten minutes a long white bundle
was borne reverently aft and laid on a hatch, where
a mass of sandstone was secured to its smaller end.
The skipper produced a worn Prayer-book, from
which, like one determined to do his duty at all
cost, he doggedly read the Order for the Burial of
the Dead right through. All hands stood round
in the moonlight with bare heads and set faces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
until the skipper’s voice ceased. Then at a sign
from the mate four of us lifted the hatch to the
rail, slowly raised its inner end and held it steadily,
while, with a slow hiss, its burden slid into the sea
and disappeared beneath a shining column of
emerald green.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LOSS OF THE FIRST-BORN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">She</span> was his latest bride; the joy of his great
heart as well as the flower of his goodly flock.
And as he swept proudly through the foaming sea,
with her graceful form gliding sinuously by his
side, at the head of the mighty school in all the
exultation of his overlordship of those Titans, he
often sprang clear into the bright air in the fulness
of his gigantic life and measureless delight of
living it. After having in this way somewhat
quieted his exuberant spirits, he swam sedately
enough by the side of his favourite again, and
resumed the serious conversation they had been
having. He told her they would arrive at the
island to-morrow, and she would then see what
a sweet spot he had selected for the birthplace
of their first-born. There was deep water right
up to the edge of the widespreading reef.
Shallow winding channels, that only sagacious
whales, humpbacks like themselves, could find or
thread amid the incessant rolling of the enormous
breakers, led into a spacious lagoon behind, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
there was no greater depth than six fathoms.
The floor of those quiet quarters was delightfully
jagged, so that she would be able easily to chafe
off every last barnacle and limpet from the lovely
folds of her charming breast. As for food, the
place was alive with tender young squid and sea-slugs,
all fat and juicy. And as he spoke he
caressed her lovingly with his fifteen-feet fin that
spread like a wing from the broad expanse of his
side, while she gazed up at him affectionately out
of the corner of her tiny eye.</p>

<p>When she instinctively expressed her fear of
the ever-vigilant sharks, who love nothing better
than a tender young calf, he comforted her by an
assurance that there was little need to fear them
there. If a stray one should come prowling
round she was to attack him at once, as he would
almost certainly be alone. Then his voice took a
graver tone as his wound reminded him of the
greatest danger of all, and one of which she had
no experience. He told her how to some of the
quiet haunts of their people came occasionally
white things, with long thin legs, walking on top
of the water. They were not nearly as big as
a whale, but there seemed to be smaller living
things in them that were terrible and dangerous.
They bit with long sharp teeth, they had arms
hundreds of feet long, and they knew no pity
even for languid mother and new-born calf. They
had killed vast numbers of the whale-folk, and
the thought of his escape from them made him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
ache with fright, though it was so many years ago.
But, happily, they could not come everywhere,
and he had chosen this shelter for her because it
was barred against them.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the school swept into sight
of a vast barrier of coral, and, settling down many
fathoms, they skirted its base rooted in the eternal
buttresses of the world. Grand and awful was
the view, but they heeded it not, being on business
bent, with no admiration to waste on the gorgeous
scene or appreciation of the untellable marvels
of the deep,—matters of every day with them.
Presently they rose near enough to the surface to
hear the solemn roar of the league-long line of
resistless breakers overhead, and, turning with
them, followed their lord and leader into one
of the channels he had spoken of. It wound its
tortuous way for a couple of miles through the
great reef, the stillness of the placid shallows
strangely disturbed by the thundering return of the
displaced water as the troop of leviathans paddled
gently through its intricacies. At length they
emerged into a wide lagoon, bounded on one side
by towering masses of black rock rising tier upon
tier for over two thousand feet. In every other
direction the sea raised a rampart of dazzling
foam, which seemed never to subside for one
moment, or reveal even a remote chance of entry.</p>

<p>For the next two days they stayed with her,
exploring every corner, finding it truly, as the
Master had said, a place of ten thousand for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
refuge from all enemies. At last, when the
patient mother-to-be had settled upon a shady
pool beneath a huge overhanging crag as her
favourite spot, they all bade her farewell, formed
into line and departed, leaving her to the unfailing
ministrations of the good Nurse Nature,
with a promise to return again in about ten days.</p>

<p>On the second day of her loneliness a little son
was born to her, a pretty, frolicsome creature
about eight feet long, his tender, shining, dark skin
elegantly mottled with splashes of grey, while the
tiny furrows of his belly were white as curd.
And the proud mother lolled in her cool corner
feeding her babe from her bounteous breast,
feeling supremely happy. He was a very wellspring
of joy to her, every move of his lithe
young body, every puff from his tiny spiracle,
giving a new pang of delight. Nor did anything
harmful come near. But she never relaxed her
vigilant watch; not the faint splash of a gannet
after a fleeting flying-fish but sent a shudder of
apprehensive energy through her mighty frame.</p>

<p>For one blissful week there was perfect peace.
Then came a morning when the glorious blue sky
grew grey and greasy, then black as soot. A
deathlike silence fell. The harmless fish and other
denizens of the reef crept into crevices of the coral,
and all the birds fled wailing away. She was
filled with an undefinable dread; a loneliness unfelt
before shrank every fibre with fear. Moving
uneasily about the restricted area of her shelter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
her calf clutched closely under her fin, she saw
spear after spear of crimson flame cleave the swart
heavens, while immense boulders of red-hot rock
fell in a hurtling hail around her. A seething
torrent of molten lava amid a dense fog of steam
fell with a deafening hiss into the sea. Desperately
she sought to descend, but forgetting the bottom so
near, dealt herself a fearful blow. Then in frantic
fear for her youngling, she rushed, holding him
closer to her breast, around the barrier, seeking
the passage through which they had entered.
Almost exhausted with her exertions, she found it,
fled along its windings with the rock heaving and
groaning around her, and at last plunged exultantly
through the boiling breakers down, down into
peace. But unsatisfied, still she toiled on to leave
that accursed place far behind, nor rested except
to breathe her offspring until she was a hundred
miles away.</p>

<p>Then, secure from that terror, she took her
ease, thinking poor mother, that all danger was
past. But alas for her hopes! A grim silent
shadow shot past as she lay basking on her side,
her calf lazily sucking. Startled into sudden
activity, she sprang forward her full length, swiftly
sweeping her wide fins back and forth in search of
her infant. Again that dark form flew past her
side, bearing away on the projecting sword from
its head the body of her first-born writhing in
sudden death.</p>

<span class="subhead">A TRUE SHARK-STORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">“How</span> very hard it is to provide for a young, fast-growing
family nowadays,” said the mother shark,
turning, for the hundredth time that morning, upon
her broad side in order to get a better view of what
might be stirring above. For nearly a week she
had been fasting—in fact ever since she came in
hurriedly at the close of a great feast upon the
stripped carcase of a recent whale. There, by dint
of the energy of her massive shoulders, her fourteen
feet of length, and fivefold rows of triangular teeth,
she had managed to secure a respectable proportion
of the spoil for the replenishing of her own huge
maw as well as for the upkeep of the fourteen
sharklings that were now restlessly darting in and
out of their cosy cave at the far end of her
capacious throat.</p>

<p>Within the immediate range of her glance a
vast black shadow obscured a wide, irregularly
shaped area of the blazing sunshine. It was so
calm that the shadow seemed stationary. In the
direction of this cool penumbra her gaze lingered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
earnestly. For hereditary instinct as well as long
experience gave her the knowledge that from the
substance of such shadows came food dropping
down, varied and toothsome, actually alive upon
rare occasions. Somewhat impatiently she wondered
at the long time that her little blue and gold
attendant had been gone. He was so seldom
absent from his place between her eyes for a whole
minute that she got quite uneasy. But while she
fidgeted fretfully, with many twitchings of her
flexible “gaff topsail,” back came the pilot-fish in
a tearing hurry. “Now then, partner, move
along, do. There’s a lump of fat pork almost as
big as your head hanging over that ship’s stern. I
don’t quite understand why it doesn’t sink, but it
<em>is</em> good. I nibbled just a crumb, and you can be
sure this time that it’s no bagful of cinders like
that nasty mouthful that gave you the chest-ache
so bad this morning.” The latter part of this
energetic exordium was lost upon Mother Shark,
being drowned in the wash set up by her great
tail-fin, which was going in grand style, starting
her off at such a rate that two or three stragglers
of the family had to skip like shrimps to get
indoors before they were left behind and lost.</p>

<p>Straight as an arrow to the mark went the tiny
guide, keeping just in front of his huge friend’s
snout. Together they swept into the shadow,
where, sure enough, a mass of meat hung just
below the sea surface, though gently lifted almost
out of water every now and then. “Oh, do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
look, Mamma! <em>there’s</em> a big fish. Is he going to
eat up that pretty little one, do you think?”—“Oh,
no, my little man,” struck in the mate, “but
you watch him <em>now</em>.” As he spoke the great grey
body took a curve laterally, a dazzling glare of white
appeared, and there, beneath the speaker, was a
crescentic gap in the smooth, livid underside,
fringed with innumerable points like <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</i>,
and as big as the gape of a coal-sack.
Around it the small pilot circled excitedly at top
speed. Slowly it rose beneath the bait, which the
mate as gently slacked away, there was a gulp, and
the big joint disappeared. There was a flash, a
splash, and an eddy. Then the rope attached to
the shark-hook concealed in that pork groaned
over the rail as it felt the strain.</p>

<p>“Lay aft the watch,” roared the mate, and
amid the trampling of many feet, a babel of directions,
and a tremendous tumult alongside, through
the writhings of the captive monster, she was
transferred forward to the lee gangway, where, by
the aid of a stout watch-tackle, she was hoisted out
of water.</p>

<p>“Don’t take him aboard,” cried the captain;
“make such an infernal mess if you do. Just
spritsle yard him ’n let him go agen.” So a piece
of scantling was got from the carpenter, pointed at
both ends, about four feet long. This they drove
through her jaws from side to side. Another wedge-shaped
piece was planted diagonally down through
her broad snout, the upper end pointing forrard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Then they cut off the wide pectoral fins, letting
the quivering carcase fall into the sea again by
the simple expedient of chopping the hook out.
“What abominable cruelty,” muttered a gentle-faced
man among the crowding passengers, as he
turned away sick at heart. But the bustling seamen
looked pityingly at him, wondering doubtless
at his lack of sporting instincts. Thus disabled,
the miserable monster plunged blindly in uncertain
directions, unable to steer herself, unheeding the
frantic caresses of her faithful little satellite, who
had almost exhausted himself by leaping up at her
as she hung struggling against the vessel’s side.
Neither did she notice the puzzled, wavering
movements of her wondering brood. So she
disappeared from the view of the laughing, happy
crowd on deck. But whichever way she rushed
she always fetched up to the surface promptly,
because of the vane in her head. Thus for a day
and a night she fought aimlessly with all the forces
of amazing vitality pent up in her huge body
against these torturing disablements, until mercifully
she fell in with a couple of ravenous
congeners. Scenting fresh blood they made for
her straightway. Like mad things they fell upon
her. Long and hard they strove, tearing their way
through the tough framework until assistance came
from all quarters, and a motley multitude of
various hungry ones cleaned up every shred of the
welcome banquet, leaving only the deserted pilot
to seek another partner.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SLAVER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Ras Nungwe</span> stood out boldly against the deep
azure of the midnight sky, its rugged outlines
softened and etherealised by the flood of molten
light flowing from the rising moon. Within the
velvety shadow which extended far to the north-westward
from that bold headland lay our brig, a
lonely, almost pathetic object, with sails all vertical
in the utter calm, and taut as boards with the
drenching dew. The royals, peering above the
enwrapping dark, gleamed silvery-white where the
unintercepted moon-rays touched them, crowning
the homely craft with a radiant halo of silver
sheen. I stood alone in the silent gloom of the
deck completely absorbed in the solemn beauty of
the scene, and utterly unmindful for the present of
the severe stress of our encompassing emergencies.
After the fierce heat of the glowing day the
caressing coolness of the hour was a pure delight,
for, although not a breath lifted the down fringing
the dog-vane suspended just above my head, there
was a freshness in the atmosphere which belied the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
thermometer. A sound rippled along through the
quiet, sending a responsive thrill over my scalp, as
of an attuned nerve. Mellow and sustained, the
clear call of the Muezzin from the minaret in
Zanzibar Town had travelled this great distance,
bearing its tremendous challenge, “Allah ho
Akbar!” Dropping all consonants on its way,
only the open vowels persisted; but even so, none
could mistake the words. Obedient even in sleep
to the call of his faith, Sa’adi, our Suahili steward,
turned upon his mat near the mainmast, and rising
to his feet, with hands outstretched before him,
began in low gutturals the majestic ritual of the
Mussulmani, “Bismillahi ’Rahmanni ’Raheem.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the swelling tide of moonlight
had invaded the sombre area wherein we lay
until the whole of the vessel was shining in
purest light. Every rope, spar, and sail, shimmering
in that wonderful luminosity, looked unearthly,
a phantom that the returning sun would dissipate
with his workaday beams. Here and there on
the deck, wherever a little shelter could be found
from the soaking dew, lay figures in many an
uneasy attitude, brokenly slumbering and muttering
through the helpless delirium of fever; for
all hands save the second mate, myself, two
Malagasy, and two Arabs, were desperately sick.
The poisonous malaria which crawls stealthily to
the Zanzibar anchorage out of the foulness of that
most filthy town, aided by the treacherous exhalations
from the soil everywhere, had stricken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
them down, and their only hope of recovery
seemed to lie in escape from that dangerous
vicinity. Therefore, but principally because of
our affection for our suffering skipper, with
his wife and child all tossing in delirium, we
had dared to get under weigh and proceed to sea
in such a plight. But now, relieved by my
careful brother officer, I went below, knowing
from painful experience that, stifling as the air
might be down in my berth, it was far safer than
on deck.</p>

<p>I awoke streaming as if in the sudatorium of
a Hammam, and after a careful rub down and
complete change of rig, returned on deck to
relieve my faithful partner. A small air from
the African land was just lifting the lighter sails,
and making a pleasant little ripple warble alongside.
One of the Malagasy, a docile Betsimasaraka,
came to the wheel, necessitating a careful watch
over his well-meant but generally misdirected
efforts on my part, since the duty was as yet
strange to him. Still, I had leisure to take my
fill of admiring wonder at the completely changed
scene. We now sailed on a sea of silver, the
moon being almost vertical. Out of that radiant
level rose the dark battlements of the great island,
its clear-cut outlines in sharp contrast to the
pellucid sky. Far ahead loomed the misty mass
of Pemba, and on the left a long, low streak of
gloom, lit up here and there by gleaming stretches
of shining sand, showed the proximity of Africa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
ancient land of mystery. A subdued murmur,
like that of a shell, but with an occasional swell
therein, was rather suggested than heard, so
unceasing was its deep monotone, the unresting
roll of the Indian Ocean upon those lonely shores.
At no great distance from us a snowy feather
occasionally showed itself where the slumbering
sea was momentarily ruffled in its regular roll
by an outlying spur of coral close to the surface.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to those bright gleams the
black blotch made by some toiling fisherman’s
small canoe showed up against the bright waters
like a patch of rock. Presently, out of the misty
environs of a small island to leeward, came the faint
but unmistakable sound of oars strenuously worked.
The night-glasses revealed the sinister shape of a
dhow heading towards us, a foam-wreath sparkling
at her bows as if she was going at a great rate.
“More slaves,” I thought bitterly, for night
navigation is not favoured by Arabs except upon
excursions that do not bear the light well.
Fervently I hoped that some of my countrymen
were lying hidden near enough to stop those
incarnate devils on their infernal errand. Forgetting
all else, I strained my eyes through the glasses
at the swiftly approaching dhow. The course he
was making would bring him closely past us, and
eventually land him at the extreme northern end
of Zanzibar Island.</p>

<p>Hoping against hope, I swept the horizon
earnestly with the glasses, my gaze lingering for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
long in the direction where lay the guardship with
five hundred eager fellows on board ready to take
any risk to stop such a villainous craft as was now
befouling the seascape, did they but know of her
presence. I had nearly given up all hope, when to
my intense delight I saw coming in our direction
from Pemba a tiny cloud of black smoke. Hardly
knowing how to contain myself, I rushed below,
found a rocket, and leaning it against the rail,
touched it off. With a hiss like a bursting steampipe
it soared aloft, scaring my poor Malagasy
helmsman almost into a fit, and bursting at a
splendid height into five blazing stars, an imperative
call to any cruising naval launch near. The flying
slaver never swerved or halted. On the contrary,
she was evidently adding to her speed. But to my
satisfaction the small black thread of smoke ahead
now showed a lurid glow running through it.
Doubtless they had grasped the intention of my
signal, and were making their little craft do her best
to obey it. Within a cable’s length the dhow passed
our stern, her straining crew yelling curses at us in
mellifluous Suahili. Pitiful, indeed, would have been
our case could those merciless flesh-hunters then
have had their will of us. But with double-banked
sweeps they strove to gain the shore, scenting the
pursuers they could not see. Nearer drew the
trailing smoke-wreath, until beneath it I could
discern the slender shape of a steam-launch. And
then I rejoiced to see her change her course so as to
cut off the dhow ere she could reach the objective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
her crew were straining every sinew to attain.
Breathlessly I watched the manœuvre, disregarding
the unwelcome failure of the gentle breeze that
again left us motionless. At last there was a flash
from the launch’s bow, followed by a sullen boom,
the sweetest sound imaginable to my hungry ears.
Another flash, and then the bright foam faded from
the dhow’s sides, showing that they had ceased
their efforts to escape. A short silence ensued,
followed by a faint rattle of small-arm fire.</p>

<p>Although the grey light of dawn was now
displacing the almost blue-black of the night sky,
the two craft were so far away that I could not
see how my brethren were faring, but almost unconsciously
I breathed a prayer for their success.
Then, in gorgeous array of green and purple and
gold, conquering daylight rushed across the sky,
paling the bright moon and quenching the sweet
stars in the ineffable glory of a new morn. All
the beauties of the adjacent shores sprang into
sight, completing the splendid picture. But, best
of all, over that devilish dhow now floated the
white-and-red folds of St. George’s Cross, whose
appearance anywhere always gives an Englishman
an accelerated heart-beat. How much more, then,
when it is seen sheltering those who were lost,
helpless, and hopeless slaves. Before long the
dhow was taken in tow by the launch, which
headed towards us. I ran up the old Red Ensign,
dipping it gaily in salute to the victors in so noble
a cause. As she passed close under our stern the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
officer in charge, waving his cap, shouted: “Many
thanks, sir, for your signal. We should certainly
have missed the prize without it. She has one
hundred and fifteen slaves on board, all ages and
both sexes, packed like sardines in a tin. It is
a splendid haul. Good-bye, sir, and a most
pleasant passage to you.” I would have answered
him in many words, but something choked my
utterance, and I could only wave my hand in
hearty farewell. I could not help a feeling of
satisfaction as I noticed several prone figures on
the dhow’s deck with crimson stains on their
dingy white garments. There are times when
the Mosaic law seems to all of us the only
satisfying adjustment of rewards.</p>

<p>Of the long days that followed before we
finally cleared those sultry shores, days of anxiety
and nights of constant care, much could be told
did space permit. One by one the haggard, quinine-saturated
invalids resumed their watch, wistfully
seeking to help, but so weak that their faltering
steps failed them oftentimes. But gradually they
gathered strength, until by the time that Zanzibar
had faded below the blue horizon every one
mustered at watch—changing, and our little
company remained complete.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CRUISE OF THE ‘DAISY’</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Something,</span> doubtless, akin to the contact of the
naked soul with its God is the feeling of
conscious nothingness that enwraps a man who
finds himself alone in some tiny craft upon the
unbroken circle of the sea. Even more so,
perhaps, when he has a vessel under his feet, than
when he survives upon some frail fabric of hastily
gathered flotsam, the lost company of his fellows.
For in the former case he has leisure for calm
thought, need for skill and energy; none of
which qualities will avail him much in the latter,
where it is but a question of a little more or less
firm hold upon fleeting life. To this conclusion
I am led from experience of both situations, about
the former of which I would fain speak now.</p>

<p>As the result of a series of adventures while mate
of an old Cumberland brig under the nominal
command of one of the most besotted drunkards
I have ever known, I found myself adrift in an
Acadian coast village early in December, friendless
and penniless. Already the icy barrier was rapidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
forming which would effectually bar all navigation
until the ensuing spring, and the thought of being
thus frozen up in helpless idleness for months,
coupled with the prospect of winter for my young
wife in England without my support, was almost
more than I could bear. Kismet threw in my
way the commander, owner, and builder of a tiny
schooner, who, disgusted with his “bad luck,”
had freighted his cockleshell with the harvest
of his farm, three hundred barrels of potatoes,
and purposed sailing for the West Indies in order
to sell vessel and cargo. Of ocean navigation he
knew nothing, all his previous nautical experience
having been confined to the rugged coasts of Nova
Scotia, so that he was highly elated at the idea of
engaging a mate with a London certificate. Not
that he would have hesitated to launch out into
the Atlantic without any other knowledge than
he possessed, without chronometer, sextant, or
ephemeris. Like many of the old school of sea-farers,
now perhaps quite extinct, he would have
reckoned upon finding his way to port in time by
asking from ship to ship sighted on the passage,
for he was in no hurry. I was in no mood for
bargaining—a way of escape was my urgent need—and
in a few hours from our meeting we were
busily rowing the wee craft down the fast-emptying
river. The crew consisted of the skipper, his ten-year-old
son, myself, and a gawky, half-witted lad
of sixteen, who strutted under the title of cook.
Bitter, grinding poverty was manifest in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
detail of our equipment, principally in the provisions,
which consisted solely of a barrel of flour,
a small tub of evil-smelling meat (source unknown),
and a keg of salt flavoured with a few herrings.
Of course, there was the cargo, and the skipper
concealed, moreover, under his pillow a few ounces
of tea, about 3 lb. of wet sugar in an oozing bag,
and a bottle of “square” gin. “Medical comforts,”
he explained, with an air of knowing what
ought to be carried on a deep-water voyage.</p>

<p>For the first five hundred miles we groped our
way through fantastic wreaths of frost-fog, its
dense whiteness enclosing us like a wall, and its
pitiless embrace threatening to freeze the creeping
blood in our veins, while, invisible, the angry
currents of the fiercest tideway in the world
bubbled beneath us like a witch’s cauldron, whose
steam was fluid ice, after whirling us top-wise in
defiance of wind and helm. Strange noises assailed
our ears, and a feeling of uncertain suspension as
though sailing in the clouds possessed our benumbed
faculties. But as if guided by an instinctive
sense of direction, the skipper succeeded in
fetching the New Brunswick shore, entering
Musquash Harbour without hesitation, and anchoring
a scant bowshot from the frozen strand.
Wasting no time, very precious now, we landed,
restoring our feeble circulation by felling a large
number of beautiful young silver birches, which,
like regular ranks of glittering ghosts, stood
thickly everywhere. Our sea-stock of fuel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
provided, we broke up the armour-plated covering
of ice over a swiftly-flowing streamlet and filled
our solitary water-cask, an irksome task, since the
water froze as we poured. With enormous
difficulty we shipped these essentials, and in all
haste weighed again, and stole seaward into the
gathering gloom. Night brought a bitter gale,
whose direction barely enabled us to creep under
a tiny triangle of canvas towards the narrow
portals of the Bay of Fundy. The flying spray
clung to masts and rigging, clothing them with
many layers of ice, till each slender spar and rope
gleamed huge above our heads through the
palpable dark. The scanty limits of the deck
became undistinguishable from the levels of an iceberg,
to which offspring of the sombre North our
little craft was rapidly becoming akin. Below, in
the stuffy, square den, the “cook” continually fed
the ancient stove with crackling birchwood and
made successive kettlesful of boiling burnt-bread
coffee, while the half-frozen skipper and his mate
relieved each other every half-hour for a brief
thaw. In such wise we reached a sheltered nook
behind Cape Sable, anchoring in a culminating
blizzard of snow, and fleeing instantly to the
steaming shelter below. Outside our frail shell
the tempest howled unceasingly throughout the
long, long night. When the bleak morning broke
the little ship was perched precariously, like some
crippled sea-bird, upon three pinnacles of rock.
The sea had retreated from us for nearly a mile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
and all the grim secrets of its iron bed lay revealed
under the cold, grey dawn. Overhead hung
gigantic icicles like sheaves of spears from the
massive white pillars that concealed our identity
with man’s handiwork, and at imminent risk we
must needs break them down in order to move the
vessel when the inrushing flood should again set
her free. Presently it came, a roaring yellow mass
of broken water, laden with all the varied débris
of that awful coast. But we were ready for it, and
by strenuous toil managed to get into a safe
anchorage.</p>

<p>Seven short days and long ghastly nights we lay
there waiting a chance to escape. Christmas came
and went, bringing with it bitter thoughts of home,
but no word was spoken on the subject. The
skipper’s little son lay feverishly tossing in the
delirium of measles, his father’s face an impenetrable
mask, but whether of stoicism or
stolidity I could not tell. At last the wind
softened, changed its direction, and breaking up
the gloomy pall of cloud, allowed a few pale gleams
of sun to peep through, welcome as sight to the
blind. Scrambling ashore, we cut down a widespreading
young spruce-tree, and after a struggle
of two hours succeeded in getting it on board with
all its matted branches intact. Then, tearing out
the anchor in a fury of energy and desire to be
gone, we stood to the southward with our strange
deck-load. A few short hours, and what a change!
As if under the breath of some kindly angel, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
ice and snow melted from around us, the pleasant
thrill of expanding life returned. It was no new
miracle, only the sweet influence of that mild but
mighty ocean river, the Gulf Stream, into whose
beneficent bosom we had crept like a strayed and
perishing child. How we revelled in the genial
warmth. With what delight we bathed our stiffened
limbs in those tepid waters, feeling life and comfort
surge back to us as if from their very source.</p>

<p>Just a little while for recovery, and then round
swung the wind again. The dismal curtains of the
sky were drawn, and the melancholy monotone of
the advancing storm wailed through our scanty
rigging. Right across the path of the great stream
it blew, catching the waves in their stately march,
and tearing their crests furiously backward.
Fiercer and louder howled the gale, while the
bewildered sea, irresistibly borne north-eastward by
the current and scourged southward by the ever-increasing
storm, rose in pyramidal heaps which
fell all ways, only their blinding spray flying
steadfastly to leeward. In that welter of conflicting
elements, whence even the birds had fled, we
were tossed like any other bubble of the myriads
bursting around. Sail was useless to steady her,
for the towering billows becalmed it; neither dared
we risk our only canvas blowing away. So when
it appeared that there was a little more truth in the
trend of the sea, we moored the cable to the trunk
of our tree and cast it overboard. And to that
strangely transformed plant we rode as to a floating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
anchor, held up head to sea, save when the
persistent swell rose astern in a knoll of advancing
water and hurled us three hundred fathoms forward
in a breath. Nine weary watches of four hours each
did I stand by the useless wheel, breathlessly eyeing
the tigerish leap of each monstrous wave until it
swept by leaving us still alive. Yet while the
skipper stood his watch I slept, serenely oblivious
of the fearful strife without. So bravely, loyally
did the little <i>Daisy</i> behave that hope rose
steadily, until just as the parting clouds permitted
a ray of moonlight to irradiate the tormented sea,
there was a sudden change in her motion. As if
worn out by the unequal strife, she fell off into the
sea-trough, a mountain of black water towered
above her, and in one unbearable uproar she
disappeared. Blinded and battered out of all sense,
I knew no more until I found myself clinging to
the wheel with a grip that left indented bruises all
over my arms. She had survived, and, as if in
admiration for her valiant fight, the sea fell and left
her safe. The tree-trunk had been sawn right
through, but its work was done.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Beneath pleasant skies we plodded southward to
our destined port, arriving uneventfully at Antigua
after a passage of thirty-five days.</p>

<span class="subhead">‘RUNNING THE EASTING DOWN’</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Despite</span> the inroads made upon sail by steam,
a goodly fleet of sailing ships still survive, many
of them magnificent specimens not only of marine
architecture, but also of the cunning handiwork
of the modern “rigger.” The enormous sail-area
shown by some of these ships and the immense
spread of their yards would have staggered the
daring skippers of forty years ago, when the
China tea-clippers were the greyhounds of the
seas, and the Yankee flyers were wiping the eyes
of their sturdy British compeers. But in order
to see these majestic vessels at their best it is
necessary to be on board one of them on a voyage
to or from the Far East. Their troubles are
often many and their hindrances great until they
reach those Southern parallels where, after a spell
of “doldrums” varying with the season, they pick
up those brave west winds that, unhindered, sweep
in almost constant procession around the landless
Southern slopes of the world. This is no place
for weaklings either among ships or men. If a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
passage is to be made and a vessel’s reputation
for swiftness, apart from steam-power, to be either
sustained or acquired, here is the field. There is
none like unto it. Not only should canvas,
hemp, and steel be of the best, but the skipper
must be stout of heart, not to be daunted by
threatening skies, mountainous seas, or wandering
islands of ice. More than all these, he must to-day
be prepared to face the probability of his
scanty crew being quite unable to handle the
gigantic pinions of his vessel should the favouring
breeze rise, as it often does, to such a plenitude
of power as to make it most dangerous for them
to be longer spread.</p>

<p>To take a typical instance: the 5000 ton
four-masted sailing ship <i>Coryphæna</i>, laden with
general merchandise for Melbourne, reached the
latitude of Cape Frio on the thirty-fifth day from
London. Like all of her class, she was but
weakly manned, but as if to provide against any
possible emergencies of sail-carrying, her enormous
masts of mild steel were quadruply stayed with
steel cables, until they were almost like an integral
part of the massive fabric herself. From truck to
mast-coat not a shaking of hemp was used for
cordage where steel wire rope or chain could be
made available. Neither were any old-time
lashings, lanyards, or seizings to be seen. Their
places were filled by screws and levers, whereby
one man could exert more power on a shroud
or a guy than was formerly possible to a dozen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
aided by a complicated web of tackles. And
the sails, those vast breadths of canvas that, when
set, made the mighty hull appear but a trivial thing
beneath their superb spread, were of the heaviest
quality woven, their seams, leaches, and roaches
fortified by all the devices known to the sailmaker.</p>

<p>The skipper paced the poop with uncertain
steps, hardly able to conceal his impatience at the
dallying of the light airs that only made the
great squares of canvas slam sullenly against the
masts, and wear themselves thin. Longingly his
eyes lingered on the western horizon, hungering
for sign of the “Westerlies.” His eager gaze
was at last rewarded by the vision of a sombre
arch of lowering cloud, which slowly upreared its
grim segment above the setting sun. The fitful
south-easterly airs, dregs of the “Trades,” which
in their feeble variableness had so sorely tried his
patience, gradually sank like the last few breaths
of some expiring monster, leaving the sea glassy
and restful under the dark violet of the evening
sky. Only a long, regular swell came rolling
eastward in rhythmical march, its placid undulations
swaying the huge vessel gently as the
drowsy rocking of an infant’s cradle. But its
indications were sufficiently precise to satisfy the
skipper, who, after a peaceful pipe, retired early
to rest, leaving orders to call him in the event
of any sudden change. His manner, however,
indicated that he expected nothing of the kind.
After his departure the chief officer prowled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
restlessly about the quarterdeck, being a man
to whom the stagnation of a calm was an
unmitigated calamity. At present his only satisfaction
lay in noting how steadily the celestial
bridge astern grew in breadth and altitude, while
at the same time the swell became deeper, longer,
and more definite in its direction.</p>

<p>By four bells the summits of the climbing
cumuli forming the immeasurable arch in the
west were right overhead, while the sky within
its radius was now overspread with a filmy veil
that hid the stars from view. Suddenly a chill
breath touched his ear, sensitive as a hound’s,
and immediately his fretful lassitude was gone.
He stood erect, alert, every nerve tense, ready
for action. “Stand by, the watch!” he roared,
and in response a few dark figures slouched into
sight from the shadowy corners where they had
been dozing away the leaden-footed hours. Then
a cool stream of air came steadily flowing from the
mysterious centre of the gloom abaft. “Square
the main-yard!” shouted the mate again; and
with eerie, wailing cries the great steel tubes were
trimmed to the coming breeze. The order was
hardly executed before, with a rush and a scream,
out leapt the west wind from its lair, while with
many a sharp report and grinding of gear being
drawn into its grooves the huge fabric obeyed the
compelling impulse and began her three thousand
league stretch to the eastward. By midnight it
blew a gale, to which the same vessel, had she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
been bound in the opposite direction, must needs
have shown but a scanty spread of sail. Now,
nothing was further from the intention of the
gleeful mate than the starting of a single thread.</p>

<p>At the relieving of the watch the skipper was
called and informed of the change, so that upon
him should rest the responsibility for “carrying
on.” For the driving fragments of storm-rent
cloud were low, and by their meteor speed foretold
that this was but a foretaste of the tempest to
follow. Planting himself in his favourite attitude
on the extreme weather-quarter, the captain fixed
his eyes on the upper sails with a look of supreme
content, though to an inexperienced gaze they
would have seemed on the point of bursting into
shreds, their very stitch-holes strained to gaping a
quarter-inch long. Every one of her thirty-four
wings were spread and drawing, for the wind being
well on the quarter, allowed of the yards being
canted forward, while the ship went “steady as a
church,” with a ten-degree list to port. Still the
wind increased and faster drove the ship, until by
daylight she was going a full sixteen knots, which, in
spite of the Yankee yarns anent the <i>James Baines</i>,
her main skysail, and her twenty-one knots, is
about the maximum possible under sail. The first
cheerless gleams of the new day revealed an awe-inspiring
view. Far as could be seen the ocean
surface was torn into snowy foam by the raging
wind, for the sea had not yet time to get into the
gigantic stride it would presently take in sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
with the irresistible march of the all-compelling
storm. “Fine breeze, sir,” chuckled the mate,
rubbing his hands with delight. “Only hope it’ll
hold,” replied the skipper, peering keenly aft into
the eye of the wind. There, to a landsman, the
sight was ominous, almost appalling. Dense masses
of distorted nimbus came hurtling out of the deep
gloom, which seemed to grow blacker and more
menacing every hour. So through the howling
day the big ship fled onward like a frightened thing,
steady and straight as an ice-yacht over Lake
Michigan, although at times an incipient sea smote
her broadside, and, baffled, cast its crest aloft, where
the shrieking blast caught it and whirled it in
needle-like particles as high as the upper topsails.</p>

<p>When night drew in the sea had fairly risen, and
came bellowing along in mountainous masses many
miles in length at a speed that bade fair to overtake
the fleeing ship. Strange it was to note how,
as the waves grew, the ship seemed to dwindle
until her huge bulk appeared quite insignificant.
And now, at frequent intervals, enormous bodies
of broken water hurled themselves on board, often
filling the spacious decks flush fore and aft with a
seething flood. And still the “old man,” hung
on, his courage and faith in the powers of his ship
being justly rewarded by a week’s run of over two
thousand miles without the loss of a rope-yarn.
Then the breeze gradually faltered, swerved from
its steadfast direction, and worked round by the
south, until at south-east it dropped lifeless for an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
hour or so. Then out from the north-east it
rushed like a raving genie, almost catching the ship
aback, and giving the scanty band of toilers a
tremendous task to handle the immense squares
of canvas that thundered like infuriate monsters
against their restraining bonds. But in a short
time the gale had veered round into the westward
again, and the <i>Coryphæna</i> resumed her headlong
race to the east. Running upon the arc of a great
circle, she gradually worsened the weather as she
reached higher latitudes. Stinging snow squalls
came yelling after her, hiding everything behind
a bitter veil. Past gigantic table-topped icebergs,
floating mountains against whose gaunt sides the
awful billows broke with deafening clangour,
flinging their hissing fragments hundreds of feet
into the gloomy sky. At last so fierce grew the
following storm that the task of reducing sail
became absolutely necessary. All hands were called
and sped aloft to the unequal conflict. Scourged
by the merciless blast, battered by the threshing
sails, they strove for dear life through two terrible
hours of that stern night. A feeble cry was heard,—a
faint splash. Only a man dropped from the
main top-gallant yard,—through one hundred and
twenty feet of darkness into the yeasty smother
beneath, and ere the news reached the deck, calm
and peaceful below the tumult, more than a mile
astern, swallowed by the ever-unsatisfied maw of
the ravening sea. And onward like a meteor sped
the flying ship, “running her Easting down.”</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Swinging</span> through the clear sky, one hundred
feet above the little stretch of white deck that
looks so strangely narrow and circumscribed, the
period of two hours assigned for a spell is often
spent in strange meditations. For all the circumstances
are favourable to absolute detachment from
ordinary affairs. A man feels there cut off from
the world, a temporary visitor to a higher sphere,
from whose serene altitude the petty environment
of daily life appears separated by a vast gulf.
Rising to that calm plane in the shimmering
pearly twilight of a tropical dawn, he is enabled
to view, as from no other standpoint, the daily
mystery and miracle of the sunrise. For he
forgets the tiny microcosm below, involuntarily
looking upward into the infinite azure until his
mind becomes consciously akin to eternal verities,
and sheds for a brief space the gross hamperings
of fleshly needs and longings. At such a time,
especially if the heavens be one stainless concave
of blue, the advent of the new day is so overwhelming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
in its glory that the soul is flooded with
a sense of celestial beauty unutterable. Beautiful
and glorious indeed are the changing tints and
varying hues of early dawn upon the fleecy fields

wondrous scene is unfavourable to the simple
settlement of wondering, worshipping thought
induced by the birth of unclouded light. At first
there appears upon the eastern edge of the vast,
sharply-defined circle of the horizon, that by a
familiar optical illusion seems to bound a sapphire
concavity of which the spectator is the centre, a
tremulous, silky paling of the tender blue belonging
to the tropical night. The glowing stars
grow fainter, dimmer, ceasing to coruscate like
celestial jewels studding the soft, dark canopy of
the sky. Unlingering, the palpitating sheen
spreads zenithwards, presently sending before it
as heralds wide bars of radiance tinted with
blends of colour not to be reproduced by the
utmost skill of the painter. Before their triumphal
advent the great cone of the zodiacal light, which,
like a stupendous obelisk rising from the mere
shadow of some ineffable central glow, to which
the gigantic sun itself is but a pale star, has
dominated the moonless hours, fades and vanishes.
Far reaching, these heavenly messengers gild the
western horizon, but when the eye returns to
their source it has become “a sea of glass mingled
with fire,”—a fire which consumes not, and,
while glowing with unfathomable splendour, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
yet a mildness that permits the eye to search its
innermost glories unfalteringly and with inexpressible
delight.</p>

<p>But while the satisfied sight dwells upon this
transcendent scene, forgetting that it is not the
only morning in earth’s history when it is to be
lavished upon a favoured world, there is a sudden
quickening of the throbbing light, along the
sharp blue edge of the ocean runs a blazing rim
of molten gold, and in a perfect silence, beneath
which may be felt the majestic music of the spheres,
the sun has come. Turn away the head; the
trembling eyes cannot for an instant dwell upon
that flaming fervent globe that at one mighty
stride is already far above the horizon. The
sweet face of the sea wears a million sparkling
smiles of welcome—everywhere the advent of the
Day-bringer has decked it with countless flashing
gems. As if ecstatic in their appreciation of the
banishment of night, a school of porpoises five
thousand strong indulge in riotous gambols.
Leaping high into the bright air, their shining,
lithe bodies all a-quiver with pure joy of abundant
life, they churn the kindly sea into foam, leaving
in their mad, frolicsome rush a wide track of white
on the smoothness behind them. So flawless is
the calm that even the tiny argosy of the nautilus
is tempted to rise and spread its silken sail, a
lovely gauzy curve just a shade or so lighter in
hue than the sapphire of the sea, and so discernible
from that height to the practised eye. In quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
succession more and more appear, until a fairy
fleet of hundreds is sailing as if bearing Titania
and her train to some enchanted isles, where never
wind blows loudly. But lo! as if at a signal from
a pigmy Admiral, the squadron has vanished
bubble-wise. From where they lately rode in
mimic pageant rises, ghost-like, a vast flock of
flying-fish, the hum of whose vibrant wing-fins
ascends to the ear. Many thousands in number,
glistening in the sunblaze like burnished silver,
they glide through the air with incredible speed,
the whole shoal rising and falling in wave-like
undulations as if in the performance of preconcerted
evolutions. They have been flying upon
a plane of perhaps twenty feet above the sea for
some five hundred yards, and are just about to
re-enter the water, when beneath them appear the
iridescent beauties of a school of dolphin (not the
dull-hued mammal, but the poet-beloved fish).
At that dread sight the solid phalanx breaks up,
hurled back upon itself in the disorder of deadly
panic. In little groups, in single fugitives, they
scatter to every point of the compass, a hopelessly
disorganised mob, whereof the weaker fall to swift
oblivion in the gaping jaws of their brilliant,
vigorous foes beneath. The main body sheer off,
sadly thinned, in a fresh direction, long quivering
raiders launching themselves in hot pursuit upon
their rear, devouring as they rush, until eaters and
eaten disappear, and the battlefield lies in placid
beauty as if never disturbed. One hovering bird,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
a “bo’sun,” with long slender tail and feathers of
purest white, circles around on unmoving, outspread
pinions, slowly turning his pretty head, with
dark incurious eyes, upon the strange biped so
awkwardly perched in his dominions of upper air.
Whence and when did he come? A moment
since and he was not. Did the vacant ether produce
him? Yet another moment and he is gone
as he came, leaving behind him a palpable sense
of loss.</p>

<p>But now all attention is concentrated upon the
horizon, where the trained eye has caught a glimpse
of something of greater interest than either bird
or fish. A series of tiny puffs, apparently of
steam, rises from the shining surface, but so evanescent
that nothing but long-practised vision would
discern them at so great a distance. Irregularly,
both as to time and position, they appear, a
shadowy procession of faintest indefinite outlines,
a band of brief shadows. Yet upon them eager
eyes are bent in keenest attention, for they represent
possibilities of substantial gain, and bring the
mind back from the realms of pure romance with
the swiftness of a diving sea-bird down to the
hard necessities of everyday life. They are the
breathings of marine mammalia, mightiest of ocean’s
citizens, and strangest of links between the inhabitants
of land and sea. A little keen scrutiny,
however, reveals the disappointing fact that those
feathery phantoms mark the presence of that
special species of whales who enjoy complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
immunity from attack either from above or below.
Their marvellous agility, no less than the exiguous
covering of fat to which they have reduced the
usually massive blubber borne by their congeners,
gives abundant reason why they should be thus
unmolested. So they roam the teeming seas in
the enviable, as well as almost unique, position
among the marine fauna of exemption from death,
except by sickness or old age, as much as any
sedate, law-abiding citizen of London. They
seem to be well aware of their privileges, for they
draw near the ship with perfect confidence, heeding
her huge shadow no more than if she were a
mass of rock rising sheer from the ocean-bed, and
incapable of harm to any of the sea-folk. From
our lofty eyrie we watch with keenest interest the
antics of these great creatures, their amatory
gambols, parental care, elegant ease, and keen
sportiveness. Yonder piebald monster, who seems
the patriarch of the school, after basking placidly
in the scorching rays of the sun, now high in
the heavens, gravely turns a semi-somersault,
elevating the rear half of his body (some forty
feet or so) out of the water. Then with steady,
tremendous strokes he beats the water, the hundred
square feet of his tail falling flatly with a reverberation
like the sound of a distant bombardment.
The others leap out of water, sedately as becomes
their bulk, or roll over and over each other upon
the surface, occasionally settling down until they
look like fish of a foot or so in length. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
even dare to chafe their barnacle-studded sides
against the vessel’s keel, sending a strange tremor
through her from stem to stern, which is even felt
in the “crow’s nest.” But no one molests them
in any way; in fact, it must be placed to the
whaler’s credit that he rarely takes life for “sport,”
though callous as iron where profit of any kind
may be secured.</p>

<p>Oh, the heat; as if one’s head were a focus
for the sun himself, since there is little else for
many leagues exposed for him to assail except the
mirror-like ocean. Thence, too, the heat rises
as if to place us between two fires, until we feel
like the fakirs of India undergoing their self-imposed
penance of the swing. How fervently
thankful we are when at last the glorious orb
descends so low that his slanting rays lose their
power in great measure, and permit us again to
take a reviving interest in our surroundings.
Yon floating tree, for instance; we have long
been wondering in a vague sort of dream what it
might be. And indeed its appearance is strange
enough to warrant considerable speculation. It
has been adrift for months, and except upon the
side which floats uppermost, is covered with barnacles,
whose adhering feet have extended in some
instances to a fathom in length, the tiny shells
being almost invisible at the free ends. This
wealth of living covering, waving gently as the
log is rocked by the unseen swell, gives the whole
thing an uncanny look, as of some strange unclassified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
monster “begotten of the elder slime.”
Around it are playing in shoals fish of many kinds
seen only in deep waters—fish of every luminous
tint that can be imagined, and ranging in size
from the lordly albacore, weighing a quarter of a
ton, to the tiny caranx of a couple of inches long.
But hush! there is a priceless freshness in the air.
The weary day is shaking off the fervent embrace
of her exhaustless bridegroom. Gentle, lovely
shades of colour are replacing the intense glow.
A little, little breeze creeps cautiously along,
ruffling the grateful sea in patches of purple
shadow. A more subdued glory gathers in the
west than heralded the sun’s ascending—a tenderer
range of tints, like the afterglow of autumn as
compared with the flaming blossoms of spring.
For a few brief moments the gorgeous golden
disc swims upon the edge of the lambent sea, and
he is gone. Swiftly following him, the brilliant
hues fade from the sky, shyly the stars peep out,
and it is night.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BIRTH OF AN ISLAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">For</span> many years Pacific mariners, both of white
and dusky races, had known and dreaded the
dangers of the Marae Reef. It lay right in the
track of vessels between Opolu and Nieuwe, only
visible to the seaman’s eye from the mast-head on
calm days as a slight discoloration of the brilliant
blue sea that everywhere else bared its unstained
depths of single colour. With a fresh Trade
blowing there was no difficulty in locating it, for it
made its menace heard as well as seen. The long,
indolent Pacific swell, sweeping majestically from
continent to continent across half the world, met
this mushroom growth in its mighty path and
immediately raised its awful voice in thunderous
protest against such an addition to the already
innumerable dangers of that perilous region.
Not only so, but as if it would uproot the intruder
from its massy foundations that broadened
down into the matrix of the world, the wrathful
wave arose in gigantic billows of foaming white,
in the midst of which momentarily appeared the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
defiant summits of living rock, steadfast and secure,
while the ageless ocean vainly sought to uproot it
from its eternal base. But such scenes were of the
most infrequent occurrence. The normal conditions
of those waters were peaceful, and the swell
scarcely heavy enough to raise even a solitary
breaker once a day. And as the scanty trade
between the islands grew less and less, the danger
of the reef, nay, almost its very existence, passed
out of men’s minds.</p>

<p>Still, heedless of either elemental strife or
serenest calm, the microscopic masons toiled on,
each in its tiny cell content to fulfil the conditions
of its being and to add its infinitesimal quota to
the world-fragment; then, having justified its
existence, to pass into other forms of usefulness by
means of the ever-active alchemy of Nature. But
for those of the builders whose lot it was to reach
the summit of the fabric which their united efforts
had reared there was another ending, or rather
transmutation. A swift oblivion awaited them, a
sudden severance from their life-work, as the reef,
now awash, was left temporarily dry by the ebbing
tide. Yet all around them uncounted myriads of
their co-workers toiled eagerly upward to the same
personal fate, the same collective achievement, each
adding some essential to form the perfect whole.
Thus from generation to generation the fabric
grew, so slowly by man’s reckoning, so swiftly
according to the hasteless chronology of creation,
until there came a day when, after a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
placid period even than usual, the bared surface of
the reef became covered with a dazzling floor of
minutest fragments, ground from the countless
pinnacles below by the unceasing attrition of the
waves. Tide after tide lapped the infant beach,
with kindliest murmur as of tender welcome, ever
bringing fresh store of shining sand, until at low
water of the spring tides there was a new spot of
earth’s surface gleaming white in that expanse of
blue, like a snowflake new-fallen upon a vast
sapphire.</p>

<p>A little bird, grey of feather and with long,
slender legs, drifted softly out of the surrounding
void, and alighted daintily upon this glistening
earth-bud with a sweet, low chirp of content that
also sounded like a note of welcome. With
delicate, mincing steps the graceful visitor pattered
over the crisp sand, prying with keen black eyes
and fine, nervous beak into every cranny and
worm-hole, and finding apparently many a tasty
morsel to reward her visit. Evening brought
another guest on family cares intent,—a huge
turtle, whose broad, buckler-like carapace rose
shining out of the limpid wave like the dome of
some naiad’s pearly palace under the silvern glow
of the broad moon. But instinct, that infallible
guide to the lesser intelligences of animate creation,
warned the expectant parent that here, for some
time at any rate, no safe <em>cache</em> might be found for
the deposit of those precious round eggs of hers.
So, after a leisurely survey of the scanty circlet, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
dragged her huge bulk lingeringly into the clear
waters again, and was immediately transformed
from a crawling reptile into a swift and graceful
creature that cleft the waves like an arrow.
Thenceforward many visitants came and went,
birds, crustacea, and fish, most of them exchanging
benefits with the new land, although any nascent
germs of vegetation lay biding their appointed time
until the sea should finally refrain from flinging an
occasional lustration across the smiling face of the
new-born islet. In due process of the suns,
however, a wandering coco-nut came with many a
backward sweep and much dallying upon the outskirts
of the surrounding reef among the bewildering
eddies, until at last a friendly wavelet caught it and
spun it up high and dry, where it lay at rest, kept
from rolling seaward again by a little ridge left in
the sand, the impress of a more than usually
vigorous breaker. In that soft scene of mild
delight day succeeded day like the passing of a
sunny afternoon dream, undisturbed by any
clamorous voice of wind or hoarse note of ravin from
the sea. Balmy airs, like the sweet breath of love,
scarcely dimpled the serene face of the blue ocean
around. In a beneficent flood the golden sunshine
lavished its treasures upon the lonely ocean beneath
by day, and by night the unaging glory of the
silver stars, among whose countless hosts the quiet
beauty of the lovely moon pursued her stately way,
was perfectly reproduced in the same limitless
mirror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>Beneath these gentle, yet irresistible, influences
that solitary coco-nut felt its dim interior ferment
with life. And out from the dead dryness of its
husk sprang two slender arms; tender, beseeching
things of a living green in almost startling contrast
to the withered, storm-tossed envelope from whence
they had emerged. In obedience to some hidden
impulse one of them bent downwards and by slow
persistence wrought its way into the sand, while the
other lifted itself erect and presently unfolded a
delicate green fan. Unwatched, unadmired, save
by that Infinite Intelligence that fills the remotest
corners of earth and sea with loveliness for Its own
delight, the tiny tree strengthened daily, mooring
itself ever deeper by spreading rootlets that reached
down through the interstices of the reef beneath,
and raising higher and higher in perfect beauty its
feathery fronds of palest green, the earliest pioneer
of the vegetable kingdom in this youthful patch of
Mother Earth. After a while, as the coast-line
extended and more of the dry land held its own
against the engirdling deep, other plants of lower
stature, but equal charm, managed to find a
congenial root-hold in this seemingly barren patch
of sand. Humble as they were, they gave to the
islet the friendly tint that all eyes love, and made it
more complete. Several migrant sea-birds halted
here, and, finding the spot exactly suited to their
needs, made it their home, laying their large eggs
barely upon the smooth sand, and rearing in happy
aloofness from all enemies their voracious broods.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Turtles no longer disdained the scanty beach as a
safe hatching place for their plentiful stores of eggs,
and strange waifs from far-away lands were arrested
in their weary oscillations about the never-resting
ocean and peacefully brought here to a final abiding-place.</p>

<p>So fared the uneventful, unnoted procession of
days, months, and years, until one morning the
now abundant, happy life of the island awoke, as
was its wont, at the first warm breath of a new
day. A soft blush of indescribable colour-blends
replaced the dark violet of the night sky, whose
shadows retreated before that conquering dawn as
if in haste to allow the advent of its coming glory.
Soon, heralded by spears, streamers, and sheaves of
shining gold, the majestic silence of his entry
smiting the waiting hemisphere like the trump of
an archangel, the great sun rose. His first level
rays glided across the glowing sea and fell upon the
wan, upturned face of a man, flung like any other
fragment of jetsam up from the heaving bosom of
the Pacific, and left apparently lifeless on the sand
near the trunk of the now sturdy tree. Under
that loving touch of reviving warmth the pale, set
features relaxed, a shudder as if of re-entering
vitality shook the gaunt limbs, and presently the
eyes unclosed. The first human visitor to the
island sat up and stared vacantly around. His upturned
eyes caught sight of the great green bunches
of delicious young fruit hanging some twenty feet
above his head, and the sight was tantalising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
beyond measure to his leathery, cracking tongue
and throat. He was far too weak to attempt such
a task as climbing the tree would have been; but
a few of the eggs that lay near soon supplied him
with fresh vigour, although the outraged birds
protested all they knew against this strange experience,
unlike anything hitherto troubling their
peaceful life. But as the man grew stronger his
proceedings troubled the original freeholders more
and more. For he collected a great heap of driftwood,
including the mast of his own vessel, upon
which he had been borne hither, and presently from
out of the midst of the heap arose a heavy black
pillar of smoke. Then through the smoke burst
flashes of fire, before which all but those birds with
young, whom no terrors would have driven them
from, fled shrieking away. As the man grew
stronger he climbed the tree, and drank greedily
from the sweet liquid filling the young nuts; but
while he sat there among the far-spreading leaves,
he saw a sight that touched him deeper than would
the most beautiful Nature picture in the world,—a
schooner making for the island. They had seen
his smoke-pillar at a great distance and altered
their course to his rescue. So he went away,
leaving behind him a terrible memory as of the
ravages of some unthinkable monster whose visit
had changed, not only the face of Nature, but all
the habits and customs of the island-folk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX<br />

<span class="subhead">A SUBMARINE EARTHQUAKE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">There</span> was a delicate tint of green over all the sky
instead of its usual deep, steadfast blue. All
around the horizon the almost constant concomitants
of the Trade winds, fleecy masses of
cumuli, were lying peacefully, their shape unaltered
from hour to hour. Their usual snowy whiteness,
however, was curiously besmirched by a shading
of dirty brown which clung around their billowy
outlines, giving them a stale appearance greatly at
variance with the normal purity of these lovely
cloud-forms. The afternoon sun, gliding swiftly
down the shining slope of heaven toward the
western edge of that placid sea, had an air of
mystery about his usually glorious disc, a wondrous
glow of unnameable tints that, streaming away
from him into the clear firmament, encircled him
with a halo of marvellous shades, all lacking the
palpitating brightness usually inseparable from
solar displays near the Equator. And over the
sea-surface also was spread, as upon a vast palette,
great splashes of colour, untraceable to any definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
source, mysterious in their strange beauty. At
irregular intervals, across that silent expanse of
peaceful limpidity, came, in stately onset, an
undulating throb of ocean’s heart,—a shining knoll
of water one hundred leagues in length, but so
mobile, so gentle in its gliding incidence, that it
was beautiful as the heaving bosom of a sleeping
naiad. The very silence, deep and solemn as
that of the stellar spaces, was sweet,—a peaceful
sweetness that fell upon the soul like the most
exquisite music, and soothed as does a dreamless
sleep.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of the indescribable charm of
that divine day, there was on board the solitary
ship that gave the needed touch of human interest
to that ocean Elysium a general air of expectancy,
a sense of impending change which as yet could
not be called uneasiness, and still was indefinably
at variance with the more manifest influences that
made for rest of mind and body. The animals on
board, pigs and cats and fowls, were evidently ill
at ease. Their finer perceptions, unbiassed by
reasoning appreciation of Nature’s beauties, were
palpably disturbed, and they roamed restlessly
about, often composing themselves as if to sleep,
only to resume their agitated prowling almost
immediately. Lower sank the sun, stranger and
more varied grew the colour-schemes in sky and
sea. Up from the Eastern horizon crept gradually
a pale glow as of a premature dawn, the breaking
of an interpolated day shed by some visitant sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
from another system. The moon was not yet
due for six hours, so that none could attribute this
unearthly radiance to her rising. Busy each with
the eager questionings of his own perturbed mind,
none spoke a word as the sun disappeared, but
watched in suspense that was almost pain the
brightening of this spectral glare. Suddenly, as if
reflected from some unimaginable furnace, the
zenith was all aflame. That fiery glow above
turned the sea into the semblance of a lake of
blood, and horror distorted every face. The still
persisting silence now lay like the paralysis of a
trance upon all, and an almost frantic desire for
sound racked them to the core.</p>

<p>At last, when it seemed as if the tension of their
nerves had almost reached the snapping point,
there was an overwhelming sulphurous stench,
followed by a muttering as of thunder beneath the
sea. A tremendous concussion below the keel
made the stout hull vibrate through every beam,
and the tall masts quivered like willow twigs in a
squall. The air was full of glancing lights, as if
legions of fire-flies disported themselves. Slowly
the vessel began to heave and roll, but with an
uncertain staggering motion, unlike even the
broken sea of a cyclone centre. Gradually that
dreadful light faded from the lurid sky, and was
replaced by a smoky darkness, alien to the
overshadowing gloom of any ordinary tempest.
Strange noises arose from the deep, not to be
compared with any of the manifold voices of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
ocean so well known to those who do business in
great waters. And the myriad brightnesses which
make oceans’ depths so incomparably lovely
throughout the tropical nights were all gone. All
was dark beneath as above. Not only so, but
those anxious mariners could feel, though they
could not see, that while the atmospheric ocean
was calm almost to stagnation, the hidden deeps
under them were being rent and disintegrated by
such an unthinkable storm as the air had never
witnessed. The fountains of the great deep were
broken up, but the floods issuing therefrom were
of cosmic flame, able to resolve even that immensity
of superincumbent ocean into its original gases and
change the unchangeable.</p>

<p>Tossing helplessly upon that tortured sea, face
to face with those elemental forces that only to
think of makes the flesh shrink on the bones like
a withered leaf, the men suffered the passage
of the hours. What was happening or was
about to happen they could only dimly imagine.
They could but endure in helplessness and hope
for the day. Yet their thoughts would wander to
those they loved, wondering dimly whether the
catastrophe apparently impending was to be
universal and the whole race of man about to be
blotted out,—whether the world were dying. What
<em>they</em> suffered could not be told, but the animals
died. Perhaps the scorching heat-waves which
continually arose, making mouths and nostrils
crack like burnt leather, and cauterising taste and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
smell as if with the fumes of molten sulphur, had
slain the beasts. The discovery of this ghastly
detail of the night’s terrors did not add much to
their fears. It could not; for the mind of man
can only contain a limited amount of terror, as the
body can only feel a limited amount of pain, which
is something to be deeply thankful for.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight there was a deafening
uproar, a hissing as of the Apocalyptic Star being
quenched, and immediately the gloom became filled
with steam, an almost scalding fog, through which
as through a veil came a red sheen. At the same
time a mighty swell swept toward them from east
to west, striking the ship full in the stem.
Gallantly she rose to the advancing wall of water
until she seemed upreared upon her stern, but in
spite of her wonderful buoyancy a massive sea
broke on board, clearing the decks like a besom of
destruction. Down the receding slope of this
gigantic billow she fled, as if plunging headlong to
the sea-bed, and before she had time to recover
herself was met by another almost as huge.
Clinging for life to such fragments as still held on
the clean-swept decks, the crew felt that at last all
was over. But the good ship survived the third
wave, being then granted a brief respite before
another series appeared. This allowed all hands a
breathing space, and an opportunity to notice that
there was a healthier smell in the air, and that the
terror-striking noises were fast dying away. When
the next set of rollers came thundering along they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
were far less dangerous than before, nor, although
they made a clean breach over the much-enduring
ship, were they nearly as trying to the almost
worn-out crew. And now, breaking through the
appalling drapery that had hidden the bright face
of the sky, suddenly shone the broad smile of the
silver moon. Like the comforting face of a dear
friend, that pleasant sight brought renewed hope
and vigour to all. Again the cheery voices of the
officers were heard, and all wrought manfully to
repair the damage done by the terrible sea. One
by one the glittering stars peeped out as the gloomy
canopy melted away, revealing again the beautiful
blue of the sky. A gentle breeze sprang up, but
for awhile it was only possible to lay the ship’s
head approximately on her course, because the
compasses were useless. The needles had temporarily
lost their polarity in the seismic disturbance
that had taken place beneath them. But that was
a small matter. As long as the celestial guides
were available, the navigators could afford to wait
until, with the rest of Nature’s forces, magnetism
regained its normal conditions. So, during the
energetic labours of the men, the morning quickly
came, hailed by them as a sight they had never
again expected to see. And what a dawn it was.
Surely never had the abundant day been so delightful,
the heaven so stainless, the air so pure. All the
more because of the extraordinary contrast between
sky and sea; for old ocean was utterly unlike any
sea they had ever before sailed upon. As far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the eye could reach the surface was covered with
floating pumice, so that the vessel grated through
it as if ploughing over a pebbly beach. Wherever
the water could be seen it was actually muddy,
befouled like any ditch. Dead fish, floating and
distorted, added to the ugliness of what overnight
was so beautiful. Most pathetic of all, perhaps,
upon that dead sea was the sight of an occasional
spot of white, a tiny patch of ruffled feathers
floating, that had been one of the fearless winged
wanderers who add so much to the beauty of the
sea, its joyous life quenched by the poisonous
fumes of the submarine earthquake.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SILENT WARFARE OF THE
SUBMARINE WORLD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">All</span> imaginative minds are inevitably impressed by
the solemn grandeur of the sea. Some shudder
at its awful loneliness, its apparent illimitability,
its air of brooding, ageless mystery in calm.
Others are most affected by its unchainable energy,
the terror of its gigantic billows, its immeasurable
destructiveness in storms. Yet others, a less
numerous class, ponder over its profundities of
rayless gloom and uniform cold, where incalculable
pressures bear upon all bodies, so that cylinders of
massive steel are flattened into discs, and water
percolates through masses of metal as though they
were of muslin. But there is yet another aspect
of the oceanic wonders that engages the meditations
of comparatively few, and this is perhaps the most
marvellous of them all.</p>

<p>Placid and reposeful, tempest-tossed or current-whirled,
the unchangeable yet unresting surface of
the ocean reveals to the voyager no inkling of
what is going on below its mobile mask, and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
when furrowed deepest by the mighty but invisible
ploughshare of the storm, how slight is the effect
felt twenty feet deep. Yet in those soundless
abysses of shade beneath the waves a war is being
incessantly waged which knows no truce, ruthless,
unending, and universal. On earth the struggle
for existence is a terrible one, exciting all our
sympathies when we witness its pitilessness, being
ourselves by some happy accident outside the area.
Nature, “red in tooth and claw,” weeding out the
unfit by the operation of her inexorable laws,
raises many a doubting question in gentle souls as
to why all this suffering should be necessary.
They see but a portion of the reversed pattern
woven by the eternal looms. But the fauna of
the land are by an enormous majority herbivorous,
mild in their habits, and terrified at the sight of
blood. Even the carnivora, fierce and ravenous
as are their instincts, do not devour one another
except in a few insignificant and abnormal cases,
such as wolves driven mad by starvation. Much
less do they eat their own offspring, although there
are many instances of this hideous appetite among
the herbivores, which are familiar to most of us.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to these conditions, the
tribes of ocean are all devourers of each other,
and, with the exception of the mammalia and the
sharks, make no distinction in favour of their own
fruit. One single instance among the inhabitants
of the sea furnishes us with a variation. The
halicore, dugong, or manatee (<i>Sirenia</i>), now nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
extinct, are, without doubt, eaters of herbage only.
This they gather along the shores whose waters
are their habitat, or cull from the shallow sea
bottoms. For all the rest, they are mutually dependent
upon each other’s flesh for life, unscrupulous,
unsatisfied, and vigorous beyond belief. “Væ
Victis” is their motto, and the absence of all other
food their sole and sufficient excuse. Viewed
dispassionately, this law of interdependence direct
is a beneficent one in spite of its apparent cruelty.
Vast as is the sea, the fecundity of most of its
denizens is well known to be so great that without
effective checks always in operation it must rapidly
become putrid and pestilential from the immense
accumulation of decaying animal matter. As things
are, the life of a herring, for instance, from first to
last is a series of miraculous escapes. As ova, their
enemies are so numerous, even their own parents
greedily devouring the quickening spawn, that it
is hard to understand how any are overlooked and
allowed to become fish. Yet as fry, after providing
food for countless hordes of hungry foes, they are
still sufficiently numerous to impress the imagination
as being in number like the sands of the sea. And
so, always being devoured by millions, they progress
towards maturity, at which perhaps one
billionth of those deposited as ova arrive. This
infinitesimal remnant is a mighty host requiring
such supplies of living organisms for its daily food
as would make an astronomer dizzy to enumerate.
And every one is fat and vigorous; must be, since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
none but the fittest can have survived. Their
glittering myriads move in mysteriously ordered
march along regular routes, still furnishing food
for an escort of insatiable monsters such as whales,
sharks, etc.; while legions of sea-fowl above
descend and clamorously take their tiny toll. In
due season they arrive within the range of man.
He spreads his nets and loads his vessels, but all
his spoils, however great they may appear to him,
are but the crumbs of the feast, the skimmings of
the pot.</p>

<p>This marvellous system of supply and demand
is, of course, seen in its highest development near
land, or at any rate where the bed of the sea is
comparatively near the surface, as on the Banks of
Newfoundland, the Agulhas Banks, and many
others. But in the deepest waters of the ocean,
far from any shore, there are immense numbers of
swift predatory fish, such as the bonito, the dolphin
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">coryphæna</i>), and the albacore. Mammalia also,
like the porpoise, grampus, and rorqual, require
enormous supplies of fish for their sustenance, and
never fail to find them. As we ascend the scale
of size the struggle becomes majestic—a war of
Titans, such as no arena on earth has seen since
the Deluge. The imagination recoils dismayed
before the thought of such a spectacle as is afforded
by the gigantic cachalot descending to the murky
depths where in awful state the hideous Kraken
broods. No other name befits this inexpressible
monster as well as the old Norse epithet bestowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
in bygone days upon the greatest of the mollusca
by terrified fisher-folk of Scandinavia. Vast, formless,
and insatiable, he crouches in those fathomless
silences like the living embodiment of sin, an ever-craving
abysmal mouth surrounded by a Medusa-like
web of unresting arms. His enormous flaccid
bulk needs a continual holocaust to supply its
flood of digestive juices, and that need is abundantly
supplied. Then comes the doughty leviathan
from above, and in noiseless majesty of power,
disdaining subterfuge, rushes straight to the attack,
every inch of his great frame mutely testifying to
the enormous pressure of the superincumbent sea.
Sometimes, stifling for air, the whale rises to the
surface dragging upward his writhing prey, though
almost as bulky as himself. In his train follow
the lesser monsters eager for their share, and none
of the fragments are lost.</p>

<p>But see the grampus hurl himself like some
flying elephant into the “brown” of a school of
scared porpoises. In vain do they flee at headlong
speed anywhither. The enemy pursues, he overtakes,
he swallows at a gulp, even as do his victims
the lesser creatures upon which they fatten in their
turn. So with the huge mackerel, which seamen
call the albacore, although as far as one can see
there is no difference between him and the tunny
of the Mediterranean but in size. What havoc he
makes among a school of his congeners the bonito!
A hungry lion leaping into the midst of a flock of
deer will seize one, and retire to devour it quietly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
But this monster clashes his jaws continually as he
rushes to and fro among the panic-stricken hosts,
scattering their palpitating fragments around him
in showers. In like manner do his victims play
the destroyers’ part in their turn. Yonder flight
of silvery creatures whose myriads cast a dense
shade over the bright sea are fleeing for life, for
beneath them, agape for their inevitable return, are
the serried ranks of their ravenous pursuers.
Birds intercept the aerial course of the fugitives,
who are in evil case indeed whithersoever they
flee. But descending the scale, we shall find the
persecuted <i>Exoceta</i> also on the warpath in their
thousands after still smaller prey.</p>

<p>Time would fail to tell of the ravages of the
swordfish, also a mackerel of great size and ferocity,
who launches himself torpedo-like at the
bulky whale, the scavenger-shark, or a comrade,
with strict impartiality. And of the “killer”
whale, eater of the tongue only of the mysticetus;
the thresher-shark, aider and abettor of the killer;
or the saw-fish, who disembowels his prey that his
feeble teeth may have tender food. Their warfare
knows no armistice; they live but to eat and be
eaten in their turn, and as to eat they must fight,
the battle rages evermore. The dark places of the
earth are full of the habitations of cruelty, but
they are peaceful compared with the sombre depths
of the sea.</p>

<span class="subhead">AN EFFECT OF REFRACTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">All</span> hands were asleep. The conduct of the
watch on deck, though undoubtedly culpable, had
just this excuse, that the ship was far out of the
track of other vessels, and lying lapped in a
profound calm, still as a ship can ever be upon
the ocean’s never-resting bosom. It was my
trick at the wheel, and although I had certainly
been asleep like the rest of my shipmates, I
presently found myself wide awake, as if an
unfelt breath had in an instant swept my brain
clear of those bewildering mist-wreaths that usually
hinder the mind on its return to tangible things
from its wanderings in the realms of the unknown.
Instinctively I glanced aloft, where the sails hung
flatly motionless, except for an occasional rippling
flap, soft-sounding as the wing of a mousing owl,
as the vessel swayed dreamily over the caressing
swell. Overhead, the bright eye of Aldebaran
looked down with a friendly gaze, but not an air
even of the faintest was there to stir the slumbering
keel. On the companion, a few feet away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the shapeless form of the mate was dimly discernible,
as in some incomprehensible tangle of limbs
he lay oblivious of his surroundings. Through
the open after-leaf of the cabin skylight came the
close, greasy-smelling reek of the little den below.
The useless compass answered my inquiring peep
with a vacant stolidity, as if it were glued to the
bottom of its bowl. Only the clock seemed alive
and watchful, telling me that for still another
hour I must remain at my post, although my
presence there was the merest formality.</p>

<p>So I turned my thoughts listlessly in the
direction of the sailor’s usual solace during long
spells of lonely watch—the building of airy
visions of shore delights, when, the long voyage
over, I should be free once more for a short
time with a little handful of fast-disappearing gold
wherewith to buy such pleasures as I could
compass. As I thus dreamed, the heavy minutes
crawled away on leaden-shod feet, while the
palpable silence enwrapped me, almost making
audible the regular rhythm of my heart. But
gradually out of this serene outward and inward
quiet there stole over me a nameless sense of fear,
why or of what I had no idea. Nay, I hardly recognised
this benumbing stealthy change in the calm
normal flow of my being <em>as</em> fear. It was an
indefinite alteration of all my faculties from healthy
restful regularity to a creeping stagnation, as of
some subtle poison disintegrating my blood and
turning it into chilly dust. All the moisture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
my body seemed evaporating, my skin grew
tighter, and my breath came in burning gasps
that scorched my nostrils and throat. Yet, while
this disabling of all my physical constituents was
progressing, my mind was actively rebelling against
the mysterious paralysis of its usually willing co-operators.
Eagerly, fiercely, it demanded a reason,
urged to instant action of some kind. Then, still
in the same fateful, hasteless manner, my terror
took a more definite shape. It, whatever was
thus sapping my most vital forces, was behind me,
I felt it; I realised it; but what or who or how
it was I could not or dared not imagine. Dimly
I dwelt upon what I felt ought to be certain, that
only about six feet of clear deck separated me
from the vacant plane of the sea, but that certainty
would not appear sure, as it ought to have done.</p>

<p>At last, by what seemed to me a superhuman
effort of will, I summoned all my resources and
turned my body round. There lay the sleeping
sea, besprinkled all over with reflections of innumerable
stars that shone scarcely less brilliant
on the smooth face of the deep than they did in
the inscrutable dome above. But among those
simulated coruscations lay what looked like the
long straight folds of a shroud. Broadening as it
neared me, it faded away before its skirts reached
the ship. My dry, aching eyeballs followed its
pallid outlines horizonwards until at that indefinable
limit where sea and sky seem to meet my fear
took shape. There in the blue-black heaven, its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
chin resting on the sea margin, glared a gigantic
skull, perfect in all its ghastly details, and glowing
with that unearthly light that only emanates from
things dead. Yet the cavernous openings of that
awful visage, deep within their darkness, showed
a lurid suggestion of red that burned and faded
as if fed from some hidden furnace beyond.
This horrible apparition, so utterly at variance
with the placid loveliness of its setting, completed
my undoing. I actually felt thankful for its appalling
hideousness as the sense that my endurance
limit was reached came upon me. With a feeling
of unspeakable gratitude and relief, I felt my
parched-up bones melt, my whole framework
collapsed, and I sank slowly to the deck, all
knowledge fading like the last flicker of an
exhausted lamp. But with the last gleam of sight
I saw the Thing, elongated out of all proportion,
suddenly snap the unseen ligament that bound
it to the horizon. And immediately, some distance
above, the sweet cool face of the lovely moon
shone full-orbed, to commence her triumphal
march across the sky. Then for an age I died.</p>

<p>By slow, painful stages life returned to me, as
if the bewildered spirit must creep and grovel
through obscene tunnels and tortuous grooves of
interminable length before it could again reanimate
the helpless tabernacle awaiting it. But so great
had been the shock, so complete the disorganisation
of all my powers, that for what seemed hours
after I became fully conscious again, I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
unable to raise an eyelash. The same profound
peace still reigned, not a sound, hardly a movement
of the vessel. Slowly my eyes unclosed.
I lay in a lake of moonlight streaming from the
radiant globe sailing up the blue, now well
advanced in her stately progress among the paling
stars. As I looked up at the splendid satellite I
wondered vaguely how I could ever have connected
such a well-beloved object with the brain-withering
terror of the immediate past. The problem was
beyond me, never an acute reasoner at the best of
times, but now mentally palsied by what I had
undergone. While I still lay in sentient inability
to move I heard the mate rise to his feet with a
resounding yawn. The familiar noise broke the
spell that held me. I rose to my feet involuntarily
and peered in at the clock, which was
on the stroke of four. “Eight bells, sir,” I said,
but in a voice so harsh and strange that the
officer could not believe his ears. “What’s that?”
he queried wonderingly. I repeated the words.
He rose and struck the bell, but came aft
immediately he had done so and peered into my
face as if to see who it was. “Ain’t ye well?”
he asked. “Y’ look like a cawpse.” I made
some incoherent reply, upon which he said quickly,
“Here, go for’ard ’n turn in, ’relse I’m damned
if ye won’t be sick.” Listlessly I answered “Ay,
ay, sir,” and shambled forward to my stuffy bunk.
My shipmates, heavy with sleep, took no notice
of me, and I turned in, to lie tossing feverishly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
every sinew in my body vibrating with pain so as
to be almost unbearable. A long spell of what
I suppose was brain fever followed, during which
the terrible vision of that middle watch was re-enacted
a thousand times with innumerable
fantastic additions. Out of that weary waste of
life I emerged transformed from a ruddy, full-faced
youth into a haggard, prematurely old man,
while nothing but my stalwart physique enabled
me to survive. For the rest of the voyage my
shipmates looked upon me with awe, as upon one
who had made a fearsome voyage into the unseen
world lying all around us, and been permitted to
return wise beyond the power of mortal speech to
express. But my silence upon the subject was only
because I really had nothing to tell. Whence came
that marrow-freezing fear I shall never know, or
why. What I <em>saw</em> was simply such a grotesque
distortion of the moon’s disc as is often witnessed
in low latitudes, when either sun or moon rising
appears to have the lower limb glued to the
horizon for quite an appreciable time, while
fragments of mist or cloud passing over the
luminous and elongated face cause strange patterns
to appear upon it. And when suddenly the connection
seems to break, the luminary apparently
springs several degrees at a bound into the clear
sky above. Just an effect of refraction—nothing
more.</p>

<span class="subhead">A WAKING NIGHTMARE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Curious</span> indeed was the freak of fortune which,
before I was thirteen years old, threw me like a
frond of drifting seaweed upon one of the scattered
cays of the Mexican Gulf. About the manner of
my arrival I propose to say nothing here; sufficient
for present purposes to note that I was entirely
alone upon that desolate patch of sand, hardly
worthy of the name of islet, its very existence as a
fragment of dry land dependent upon a bristling
barrier of black boulders that bared their ravening
fangs at every ebb. When the tide was up their
position was solely marked by long lines of snowy
breakers whose magnitude, accumulated by a protracted
struggle shorewards over the vast outlying
coral banks, was enormous,—so huge, in fact, that
it was seldom possible, even when standing upon
the apex of the islet, to see the horizon line, which
stretched its perfect circle all around.</p>

<p>The defending fringe of jagged rocks formed
by no means a continuous barrier. In fact it was
more properly a series of parallels sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
separated to have admitted small vessels between
them, should the turbulent swell ever be quiet
enough to permit such daring navigation. At one
point a sort of causeway ran seaward some
hundreds of feet at right angles to the beach.
The crags of which this was composed were bared
at half ebb, but from their tops one could in places
look down into blue hollows where no bottom
could be seen. Except when the wind was high,
this ridge, though exceedingly difficult to traverse,
from its broken character, was protected from
battering seas. Lying, as it did, so much nearer
the land, and in a different direction to the other
barriers, it was sheltered by them to such an extent
that only upon rare occasions was it swept from
end to end by a lingering, lolloping swell that did
not break.</p>

<p>Driven by that same pitiless necessity that had
compelled me to ferret out the means of existence
somehow since I reached my tenth year, it was no
long time before I discovered that this rugged spur
was the best place for fishing, especially with regard
to Crustacea, because a multitude of fish inhabited
the irregular cavities of the reef beneath. And
since I had water in abundance, a 400-gallon tank
full having washed ashore from the wreck, while of
biscuit and fishing-tackle there was also some
store, I spent a good deal of my time upon the uneven
pathway formed by this natural pier. Contenting
myself with small bait cut from some
luckless baby octopus I always waylaid at starting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
I was untroubled by fish too large for my immature
strength, though on several occasions I only just
succeeded in tearing half the palpitating body of
my catch out of the eager jaws of some monster
that rushed at him as he made his involuntary
journey upwards.</p>

<p>Although so young, I was fairly seasoned to
alarms and not at all nervous, which was as well,
for if I had been I should probably have died of
fright during the first night of my stay on the islet.
But there was one inexplicable noise that always
made me feel as if I had swallowed a lump of ice
accidentally when I heard it. Even while on board
the ship I never felt easy about it, the less so
because I could never find an explanation of its
origin. It sounded as if some giant had smitten
the sea flatly with a huge paddle, or, still more, as
if an extra large whale were “lob-tailing”—<i>i.e.</i>
poised in the water head downwards, and striking
deliberate blows upon its surface with his mighty
flukes. This is a favourite habit with the larger
cetacea, but only in the daytime, although I did
not then know of it. The noise which scared me,
however, was only heard at night, when, with a
calm sea and not a breath of wind stirring, it
assailed my ears like a summons from the unseen
world. For this cause alone I was always glad to
see the blessed daylight flooding the sky again.</p>

<p>Several days wore away uneventfully enough,
and I was getting quite inured to silence and
solitude, when it befell that the ebb came late in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the afternoon. By the slant of the sun I judged
it must be somewhere about five o’clock when I
climbed out along the slippery causeway to my
favourite spot—a smooth hollow in the crest of a
great boulder, from which comfortable perch I
could look down on either side into deep, blue
water. Here I seated myself cosily, and soon
hauled up a dozen or so of sizable fish. Then,
having ample provision, I rolled up my line, and
lounged at ease, sleepily surveying the unspeakable
glories of the sunset. Whether in the body or out
of the body I cannot tell, but the time slipped
away unnoticed by me, till suddenly I started up,
every nerve tingling with fear at the sound I so
much dreaded somewhere very close at hand. I
trembled so violently that I could not go back just
yet; indeed, I could not stand, but sank into my
stony seat. At that moment I turned my head to the
right, and saw rising out of the water apparently
quite slowly a hideous shape, if shape it could be
said to possess any. In the gathering gloom it
appeared almost like a gigantic bat as far as its
general outline could be seen, but I never heard of
a water-bat. For quite an appreciable space it
hung in the quiet air, changing all the placid beauty
of the evening into brain-benumbing horror for
me; then with an unfolding movement it fell upon
the glassy surface, producing the awe-inspiring
sound I had so often shuddered at, its volume
augmented tenfold by its nearness. Like some
fascinated bird, I remained motionless, staring at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the rapidly smoothing spot where the awful thing
had disappeared. Then suddenly the sea at my
feet became all black, and out of its depths there
arose close at my side a monster that was the
embodied realisation of my most terrified imaginings.
Its total area must have been about 200
square feet. It was somewhat of a diamond shape,
with a tapering, sinewy tail about as long again
as its body. Where I judged its head to be was a
convex hollow, which opened widely as it rose,
disclosing rows of shining teeth, set like those of a
human being. At each side of this gulf rose a
spiral horn about two feet long, looking like twisted
whalebone, and guarding the eyes which lay between
them. Oh, those eyes! Though not much more
than twice as large as a horse’s, as they glared
through the wide slits within which they festered
the ruddy sheen of the sunset caught them, making
them glow bloodily with a plenitude of ghastly
ferocity that haunts me yet. And on either side
of the thing undulated gigantic triangular wings,
raising its mass into the air with noiseless ease.</p>

<p>All this and more I saw in the breathless space
of its ascent; then it hung between me and heaven,
the livid corrupt-looking corrugations of its underside
all awork, as it seemed, to enfold my shrinking
flesh. Those fractions of a second, stretched into
hours, during which my starting pupils photographed
every detail of the loathsome beast, passed
away at last, and it descended slantingly over me.
Then amidst a roar of water in my ears the darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
swallowed me up, and I knew no more. I am
inclined to think that I owe my life to the trancelike
state into which I had fallen, for although it
appeared a frightfully long time before I saw the
sweet evening light again, I was not nearly so
exhausted as I have been on other occasions, when
compelled to take a long dive. But after I had
scrambled up on to the rock again, wondering to
find myself still alive, such a recurrence of overmastering
fear seized me that it was all I could do
to crawl crab-wise over the stony pinnacles back to
the sand again. My strength only held out until
I had reached a spot above high-water mark.
There I subsided into blissful unconsciousness of
all things, and knew no more until a new day was
far advanced, and the terror of the previous night
only a distressing memory apparently of some
previous stage of existence. Years afterwards I
learned that the hideous thing which had thus
scared me almost to death was one of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">raiidæ</i>,
or skate tribe. Locally it is known as the alligator
guard, or devil fish, and, truly, its appearance
justifies such an epithet. It is apparently harmless
to man, but why, alone among the Cephalopteridæ,
it should have the curious habit of taking these
nocturnal leaps out of water is a mystery.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DERELICT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">She</span> had been a staunch, well-found wooden
barque of about 800 tons, English built, but, like
so many more of our sturdy old sailing ships, in
the evening of her days she had been bought by
the thrifty Norwegians. She bore on her ample
stern the faded legend, <i>Olaf Trygvasson, Trondhjem</i>.
Backwards and forwards across the North Atlantic
to Quebec in summer, and to the Gulf Ports
in winter, she had been faithfully drogueing
timber for them for several seasons, her windmill-pump
steadily going and the owners’ profits
accumulating.</p>

<p>This last voyage, however, had been unfortunate
from its commencement. To the serious annoyance
of Trygvasson and Company, no outward
freight was obtainable, while the passage was half
as long again as it should have been. A cargo
was secured at last in Pensacola, with which not
only was her capacious hold crammed, but the
whole deck fore and aft as high as the shearpoles
was piled with the balks, so that from the forecastle-head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
to the taffrail she was flush—a windswept
stretch of slippery uneven planks with just
a hole left here and there for the hard-bitten
mariners to creep down to their darksome dens
below. They were hardly clear of the harbour
when one of those hurricane-like squalls so
common to the Florida Gulf burst upon her,
tearing a whole suit of sails from the yards and
stays and sending them fleeting to leeward like
fluttering clouds of spindrift. Then gale after
gale buffeted her with unrelenting severity, treating
the stolid, long-suffering crew with persistent
cruelty as they crept wearily about the bitter
eminence of the deck-load or clung half-frozen to
the yards wrestling with the crackling ice-laden
canvas. There were no complaints, for Scandinavian
seamen endure the bitterest hardships with
wonderful patience, growling—that well-used
privilege of British seamen—being almost unknown
among them.</p>

<p>At last there came a day when the wind grew
more savage than they had yet borne,—wind with a
wrathful tearing edge to it, as well as a force
against which none of their canvas would stand
for a moment. As a last resource they hove her
to under a tarpaulin cut from the lazarette hatch,
only two feet square, which they lashed in the
mizen rigging. This steadied her for some hours,
keeping her head to the wind fairly well, until a
sea came howling down out of the grey hopelessness
to windward and caught her on the weather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
quarter. It twisted her up into the wind, wrenching
off the rudder-head as you would behead a
shrimp. Helpless, she fell off on the other tack
just in time for a black mountain of solid water to
hurl itself upon the bluff of her bow and sweep
aft, tearing away with it boats, men, and all else
that stood or lay in its way. When that great
flood had subsided she was a silent ship. The
only member of the crew left on deck was he who
had been the helmsman, but was now only a heap
of broken bones lying in a confused tangle just in
the little space behind the wheel.</p>

<p>And then, being entirely at the mercy of the
howling wind and scourging sea, the doomed ship
was gradually stripped of her various furniture.
Yards, released from position by the carrying away
of the braces, battered and banged about until
they and their supporting spars fell in ruin on the
deckload and thundered alongside at the sturdy
hull. While this dismantling was in progress, a
small boy of about thirteen cowered in the murky
cabin as far out of reach of the invading flood of
salt water as he could get, wondering wearily
when the clamour overhead would subside and
somebody come below again. He was a London
waif, who, unwanted and forlorn, had been for
several years drifting about the world, the sport
of every cross current of mischance until he had
landed at Pensacola, where Captain Neilsen, of
the <i>Olaf Trygvasson</i>, had in pity for his youthful
loneliness given him a passage to London in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
exchange for his services as cabin-boy. Although
fairly well versed in seafaring—for he had been
nearly two years at the poor business—he marvelled
mightily at the uproar above and how it was he
heard no voices. The noise of falling spars, the
dull crashing blows of the sea, and the melancholy
wailing of the wind were still so deafening that he
was able as yet to console himself with the thought
that puny human cries would be inaudible. But
at last his suspense grew unbearable, and dropping
into the water, which was well above his waist, he
struggled on deck, to find himself sole representative
of the crew, and the vessel derelict.</p>

<p>A horror of great loneliness fell upon him.
Long experience of hardness had made him dry-eyed
upon most occasions where tears would seem
to be indicated in one so young, but something
clutched his throat now that made him burst into
a passionate fit of crying. In the full tide of it he
suddenly stopped and screamed frantically, “Larsen!
Petersen! Jansen!” but there was no voice nor any
that answered.</p>

<p>The wind died away and the sea went down.
There was a break in the pall of gloomy clouds,
through which the afternoon sun gleamed warmly,
even hopefully. But the brave and much-enduring
old vessel was now water-logged, kept afloat solely
by her buoyant cargo. She lay over at an angle
of about 45°, the waves lap-lapping the edge of
the deckload on the lee-side. Without motive-power
or guidance, the sport of the elements, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
drifted helplessly, hopelessly anywhither, a danger
to all navigation during the hours of darkness
because almost invisible. And since she moved
not except with the natural oscillation of the ocean,
the rank parasitic life with which the sea teems
fastened upon her hungrily wherever the water
reached, so that in a short time she began to smell
ancient and fish-like as Caliban.</p>

<p>Amidst that rapidly increasing growth of weed
and shell, the lonely lad moved ghost-like, his
sanity preserved as yet by the natural hopefulness
of youth. But a fixed melancholy settled and
strengthened upon him. He ate barely sufficient
to support his frail life, although there was a
sufficiency of coarse food and water for many days.
At intervals he held long rambling conversations
with himself aloud, peopling the solemn silence
around him with a multitude of the creatures of
his fancy. But mostly he crouched close down to
the lee edge of the deckload, gazing for hours at a
stretch into the fathomless blue depths beneath
him; for the weather had completely changed,
the drift of the derelict having been southward
into a region of well-nigh perpetual calm, apparently
unvisited by storms or tenanted ships.</p>

<p>Day after day crawled by—how many the
solitary child never knew, for he kept no reckoning.
Longer and longer grew the dark festoons of dank
weed around the battered hulk, while the barnacles,
limpets, and other parasites flourished amazingly.
In those calm waters whither she had drifted fish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
of all shapes and sizes, usually unseen by mortal
eyes, abounded. They swarmed around the weed-bedraped
hull as they do about a half-tide rock in
some quiet cove unvisited by man. As the calm
persisted these marine visitants grew quainter and
more goblin-like of shape, fresh accessions to their
numbers continually reaching the surface. Pale
eyes unfamiliar with the naked sunlight blinked
glassily at the garish day out of hideous heads,
and the motion of these denizens of the cold
darkness below was sluggish and bewildered. The
water became thick with greasy scum and the
usually invigorating air took on a taint of decay,
the stench of a stagnant sea. To the boy’s disordered
vision these gruesome companions grew
more uncanny than the dreams of a madman, but
still, though they daily multiplied until the water
seemed alive with them, the strange fascination
they exerted over him conquered his natural
repugnance to slimy things all legs and eyes, that
crawled horribly near. He could hardly spare
sufficient time for such scanty meals as he needed,
and must fetch from his hoard in an upper bunk
on the weather-side of the cabin well out of reach
of the encroaching, restless flood that invaded
almost every other nook. Far into the night, too,
under the stately stars, when the glazing sea was
all aglow with living fires brightening and fading
in long lines running in a multitude of directions
and of a rich variety of colours, he remained, as if
chained to the rail, staring steadfastly down at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
phantasmagoria below with eyes that scarcely
blinked, though they ached and burned with the
unreasoning intensity of his gaze. His babbling
ceased. He spoke no word now, only brooded
over the unhealthful waters like some paralysed
old man. Voices came whispering strange matters
in his ears, tales without beginning or end, incoherent
fragments of mystery that wandered through
the twilight of his mind and left no track of
sense.</p>

<p>At last one night he crept wearily into his bunk
for a morsel of food, meaning to bring it on deck
and resume his unmeaning watching of the sea. But
when he had put a biscuit in the breast of his
jumper and tried to clamber back over the black
flood that with sullen noise swept to and fro in the
darkened cuddy, he found himself unable to move,
much less to creep monkey-wise from point to
point to the scuttle. So he lay back and slept,
never heeding the weakness and want of feeling in
his wasted limbs. When he awoke it was day, a
long shaft of sunlight piercing an opening in the
deck over his head and irradiating the gloomy den
in which he lay. Suddenly there was a sound of
voices, a cheery, hearty hail of “Anybody aboard
this hooker? Hullo, derelict, ahoy!” He heard
and smiled feebly. Such voices had been his
constant companions for days, and although he
felt dimly that they sounded different now, he was
only too certain that they would change into
malignant mockeries again directly. Then all was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
still once more, save for the ceaseless wash of the
waves against the weed-hung bulkheads of the cabin.</p>

<p>Outside upon the shining sea rode that most
beautiful of all craft, a whale-boat, whose trim
crew lay on their oars gazing curiously and with a
certain solemnity upon the melancholy ruin before
them. The officer in charge, a young lieutenant
in the smart uniform of the American navy, stood
in the stern-sheets pondering irresolutely, the undertones
of his men falling unmeaningly upon his ears.
At last he appeared to have made up his mind, and
saying, “Pull two, starn three,” put the tiller hard
over to sheer the boat off to seaward, where the
graceful shape of his ship showed in strong relief
against the blue sky. But the sturdy arms had
barely taken twenty strokes when, as if by some
irresistible impulse, the officer again pressed the
tiller to port, the boat taking a wide sheer, while
the crew glanced furtively at his thoughtful face
and wondered whatever he was about. Not until
the boat headed direct for the wreck again did he
steady the helm. “In bow, stand by to hook on!”
he cried sharply, and as the boat shot along the lee-side,
“unrow.” “Jemmy,” to his after-oarsman,
“jump aboard and see if you can get below,
forrard or aft. If she isn’t bung full you might
find something alive.” “Ay, ay, sir,” said Jemmy,
a sturdy little Aberdonian, and in ten seconds he
was scrambling over the slippery timbers towards the
cuddy scuttle. Plump! and he disappeared down
the dark hole. Two minutes’ breathless suspense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
followed, a solid block of silence, then a perfect
yell of delight startled all the watchers nearly out
of their wits. The dripping head of the daring
Scot reappeared at the scuttle ejaculating in choicest
Aberdeen: “Sen’s anither han’ here gin ye wull,
sir. Ah’ve fun’ a laddie leevin, an’ thet’s a’.” In
a moment another man was by his side, and the
frail little bundle of humanity was passed into the
boat with a tender solicitude beautiful to see in
those bronzed and bearded men.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, in a voice choked with emotion,
said, “Poor little chap! Somehow I felt as if I
<em>couldn’t</em> leave that ship. Give way, men; he’s so
nearly gone that we must get him aboard sharp if
we’re going to save him after all.” The crew
needed no spur, they fairly made the boat fly
towards the ship, while the officer, with a touch
almost as gentle as a mother’s, held the boy in his
arms. When she arrived alongside the <i>Essex</i>
everything was in readiness, the fact of a life being
at stake having been noted a long way off. He
was gently lifted on board and handed over to the
doctor’s care, while the crew were piped to gunnery
practice and the dangerous obstruction of the
derelict smashed into a mass of harmless fragments.</p>

<p>A few days of such unceasing care as a king might
desire in vain, and the boy took firm hold on life
again. But his youthful elasticity of spirit has never
returned to him. A settled gravity has taken its
place, remaining from the time when he kept his long
and lonely vigil on the <i>Olaf Trygvasson</i>, derelict.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME OCEANIC BIRDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> is surely a matter for congratulation that the
sentiment of mankind toward what we are pleased
to call the lower animals is certainly, if slowly,
tending in the direction of kinder and more
merciful appreciation of them in nearly all their
varieties as knowledge of them grows from more to
more. As perhaps is but natural, this benevolent
feeling is most strongly marked for birds, those
feathered Zingari of the air whose blithe evolutions
above are more envied by man than any other
power possessed by the vastly varied members
of the animal kingdom. In obedience to the
growing demand for more intimate knowledge of
birds and their habits whole libraries have been
written, and still this literature increases; but
while in this there is nothing to cavil at, one
cannot help feeling that the marvellous life of the
sea-birds has received far from adequate attention.
Like so many other denizens of that vast and
densely populated world of waters, their inaccessibility
has hindered that close observation by trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
naturalists necessary in order to describe them as
they deserve, while as yet no marine Richard
Jefferies or White of Selborne has arisen. And
this want is really to be wondered at, seeing how
fascinating is the study of oceanic fauna, and
remembering what a wealth of leisure is enjoyed
by masters of sailing ships, which alone afford
opportunities for observing the life of the sea-people.</p>

<p>Easily first in point of interest, as well as size,
comes the lordly albatross, whose home is far south
of the Line, and whose empire is that illimitable
area of turbulent waves which sweep resistless
round the world. Compared with his power of
vision (sailors give all things except a ship the
epicene gender “he”), the piercing gaze of the
eagle or condor becomes myopic, unless, as indeed
may be the case, he possesses other senses unknown
to us by means of which he is made aware of
passing events interesting to him occurring at
incredible distances. Out of the blue void he
comes unhasting on motionless pinions, yet at such
speed that, one moment a speck hardly discernible,
turn but your eyes away, and ere you can again
look round he is gliding majestically overhead.
Nothing in Nature conveys to the mind so
wonderful an idea of effortless velocity as does his
calm appearance from vacancy. Like most of the
true pelagic birds, he is a devourer of offal, the
successful pursuit of fish being impossible to his
majestic evolutions. His appetite is enormous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
but his powers of abstinence are equally great, and
often for days he goes without other nourishment
than a drink of the bitter sea. At the Gargantuan
banquet provided by the carcass of a dead whale,
he will gorge himself until incapable of rising from
the sea, yet still his angry scream may be heard as
if protesting against his inability to find room for
more provision against hungry days soon to follow.
Despite his incomparable grace of flight when
gliding through mid-air with his mighty wings outspread,
when ashore or on deck he is clumsy and
ill at ease. Even seated upon the sea his proportions
appear somewhat ungainly, while his huge
hooked beak seems too heavy to be upheld. On
land he can hardly balance himself, and the broad
silky webs of his feet soon become lacerated. Thus
his visits to the lone and generally inaccessible
rocks which are his breeding places are as brief as
may be, since even conjugal delights are dearly
purchased with hunger and painful restraint. A
true child of the air, land is hateful to him, and
only on the wing does he appear to be really at
home and easeful.</p>

<p>The other members of the albatross family,
who, with their chief (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Diomedea exulans</i>), are all
classed by whalers under the ugly name of
“gooneys,” bear few of the majestic characteristics
of their great head. The “mallymoke,” which
comes nearest to the albatross in size and beauty,
is actually found north of the Line, a fact which
severs this bird very widely from the albatross in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
geographical range. Also, he is much livelier and
more given to bustle fussily about. It costs him
far less exertion to rise from the sea for flight
than the unwieldy paddling run along the surface
necessary to give sufficient impetus for raising the
huge albatross, and consequently his alightings are
much more frequent. But he is undoubtedly a
beautiful bird, suffering only by comparison with
the most splendid of all sea-fowl. A brown kind
of albatross, with a dirty white beak, is very much
in evidence south of 20° S., dropping continually
into the turbulence of a ship’s wake, and diving to
considerable depths after scraps. Sailors call them
Cape hens, for some misty reason which is never
given. Among Southern birds they occupy much
the same place in the esteem of those who are
acquainted with them as does the sparrow at home.</p>

<p>A general favourite among seamen is the Cape
pigeon, a pretty, busy little sea-bird about the size
of a dove, but plumper, with a black head and an
elaborate pattern in black and grey upon the white
of its open wings. Around the stern of any passing
ship large numbers of these fluttering visitors
hover continually, their shrill cries and unwearying
manœuvres contrasting pleasantly with the deep
monotone made by the driving keel through the
foaming sea. In common with most Southern
sea-birds having hooked beaks, they are easily
caught with hook and line, but will not live in
captivity. Thoughtless passengers, wearied with
what they call the tedium of the voyage, often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
amuse themselves by shooting these graceful
wanderers, although what satisfaction may be
found in reducing a beautiful living thing to a
useless morsel of draggled carrion is not easy to
see. Occasionally a passing ship finds herself
accompanied for a very short time by large flocks
of small dove-coloured birds, who, however, do
not seem to care much for the association with
vessels so characteristic of sea-birds generally.
These are known as whale-birds, probably because
in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i> that goes on round the carcass of a
dead whale they are never seen. Indeed they
would stand but little chance of a meal among the
hordes of larger and more voracious feasters.
Mention must also be made of a peculiar and unprepossessing
member of the petrel family, which
looks much like a disreputable albatross, but is
somewhat scarce. Known indifferently among
whalemen as the “Nelly” or the “stinker,” it
seems probable that this bird is the Southern
representative of the Arctic fulmar, which is
abundant in the North. His chief peculiarity is
his forwardness. No sooner does a whale give
up the ghost than the Nelly boldly alights upon
the black island-like mass and calmly commences
to peck away at the firm blubber, while thousands
upon thousands of other birds wait impatiently
around, not daring to do likewise. Hence the
terrible threat current in whaleships, “I’ll ’light
on ye like a stinker on a carcass.”</p>

<p>At the bottom of the size scale, but in point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
affectionate interest second to none, comes the
stormy petrel, or Mother Carey’s chicken, a
darling wee wanderer common to both hemispheres,
and beloved by all sailors. With its
delicate glossy black-and-brown plumage just
flecked with white on the open wings, and its
long slender legs reaching out first on one side
and then on the other as if to feel the sea, it
nestles under the very curl of the most mighty
billows or skims the sides of their reverberating
green abysses content as hovers the lark over a
lush meadow. Howling hurricane or searching
snow-blasts pass unheeded over that velvety black
head. The brave bright eye dims not, nor does
the cheery little note falter even if the tiny traveller
must needs cuddle up close under the lee of some
big ship for an occasional crumb. Only once
have I known an individual cruel or senseless
enough to harm a stormy petrel, and then the
execrations of his shipmates fairly scared him into
repentance. They seem to have solved the secret
of perpetual motion, and often at night a careful
listener may hear their low cry, even if he be not
keen-sighted enough to see them flit beneath him.</p>

<p>Quite apart from these true oceanic nomads are
the large class of sea-birds who, while gathering
their food exclusively from the sea, never go to
any great distance from land. This difference
between them and the birds before mentioned is
so strongly marked, that unobservant as sailors are
generally, there are few who do not recognise the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
vicinity of land upon catching sight of a man-o’-war
bird, booby, gannet, or bo’sun. All these birds,
whose trivial designations seem somehow more
appropriate than the nine-jointed nomenclature
of the schools, frequent for preference more
accessible shores than the craggy pinnacles generally
chosen by the bolder outfliers. Of the first-named,
the “man-o’-war” or “frigate” bird,
very little can be said to his credit. Michelet
has rhapsodised about him in a curious effusion,
of which one can only say that he seems to have
confused three distinct birds under one head.
Were this bird to receive an entirely appropriate
title, it would be “pirate” or “buccaneer,” since
it is only upon the rarest occasions that he
condescends to fish for himself, choosing rather to
rob humbler birds of their well-earned prey. No
sea-bird mounts so high as he, rising into the clear
blue until only a black speck to the unassisted eye.
Usually, however, he contents himself with a circling
poise at an altitude of about 200 feet, whence he
keeps steadfast watch upon all that transpires beneath.
With his long tail dividing and closing like the
halves of a pair of shears, and the brilliant scarlet
pouch at his neck occasionally inflated, he waits,
waits, until some fussy booby, like an overladen
housewife hurrying home from market, comes
flapping along towards her nest. Then the broad
pinions suddenly close, and down like a meteor
comes the marauder. With a wild shriek of
terror booby disgorges her fish, but ere it reaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
the water out hash the black wings again, and with
a grand swoop the assailant has passed beneath his
frightened victim, caught the plunder, and soared
skyward. In like manner these birds may sometimes
be seen to catch a flying fish on the wing, a truly
marvellous feat. It is, nevertheless, a pathetic sight
to see them, when old age or sickness overtakes them,
sitting in lonely dignity among the rocks where
they breed, helplessly awaiting with glazing eyes and
dropping plumage the tardy coming of deliverance.</p>

<p>As for the booby, whose contemptuous name
is surely a libel, space is now far too brief to do
anything like justice to its many virtues. In a
number of ways it corresponds very closely with
the manners of our domestic fowls, notably in its
care of its brood, and utter change in its habits
when the young ones are dependent upon it. Of
stupidity the only evidences really noticeable are
its indifference to the approach of generally
dreaded dangers when it is drowsy. At night one
may collect as many from their resting-places as
can be desired, for they make no effort to escape,
but look at their enemy with a full, steady eye
wherein there is no speculation whatever. Numberless
instances might be collected where the tameness,
as well as the abundance, of boobies have been the
means of preserving human life after shipwreck,
while their flesh and eggs are by no means unpalatable.
Of several other interesting members of the
great family of oceanic birds we have now no room
to speak, but hope to return to the subject later on.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE KRAKEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Never,</span> within the history of mankind, does there
appear to have been a time when dwellers by the
sea did not believe in some awful and gigantic
monsters inhabiting that unknown and vague immensity.</p>

<p>Whether we turn to Genesis to find great sea-monsters
first of created sentient beings, or ransack
the voluminous records of ancient civilisations, the
result is the same. What a picture is that of the
Hindu sage in the Fish Avatar of Krishna, finding
himself and his eight companions alone in their ark
upon the infinite sea, being visited by the god as
an indescribably huge serpent extending a million
leagues, shining like the sun, and with one
stupendous horn, sky-piercing.</p>

<p>In the brief compass of this chapter I do not
propose to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">réchauffer</i> any sea-serpent stories,
ancient or modern. More especially because my
subject is the Kraken, and while I hold most
firmly that the gigantic mollusc which can alone
be given that title is the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fons et origo</i> of all true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
sea-serpent stories, it is with facts relating to the
former that I have alone to deal. As might have
been expected, all stories of sea-monsters have a
strong family likeness, showing pretty conclusively
their common derivation, with such differences as
the locality and personality of the narrative must
be held accountable for. But among sea-folk, as
among all people leading lives in close contact with
the elemental forces of Nature, legends persist
with marvellous vitality, and so the story of the
Kraken is to be found wherever men go down to
the sea in ships, and do business in great waters.</p>

<p>Substantially the story is: that long low-lying
banks have been discovered by vessels, which have
moored thereto, only to find the supposed land
developing wondrous peculiarities. Amid tremendous
turmoil of seething waters, arms innumerable,
like a nest of mighty serpents, arose from the
deep, followed at last by a horrible head, of a bigness
and diabolical appearance unspeakably appalling.
Fascinated by the terrible eyes that, large as shields,
glared upon them, the awe-stricken seamen beheld
some of the far-reaching tentacles, covered with
multitudes of mouths, embracing their vessel,
while others searched her alow and aloft, culling
the trembling men from the rigging like ripe fruit,
and conveying them forthwith into an abysmal
mouth where they vanished for ever.</p>

<p>Such a story, especially when embellished by
professional story-tellers, has of course met with
well-merited scepticism, but sight has been largely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
lost of the fact that from very early times much independent
testimony has been borne to the existence
of immense molluscæ in many waters, sufficiently
huge and horrific to have furnished a substantial
basis for any number of hair-raising yarns. And
having myself for some years been engaged in the
sperm whale fishery, all over the globe, I now
venture to bear the testimony of another eyewitness
to the truth of many Kraken legends,
however much they may have been, and are now,
doubted.</p>

<p>To eager students of marine natural history,
nothing can well be stranger than the manner in
which, with two or three honourable exceptions,
the sperm whale fishers of the world have “sinned
their mercies.” To them as to no other class of
sea-farers have been vouchsafed not glimpses
merely, but consecutive months and years of the
closest intimacy with the secret things of old ocean,
embracing almost the whole navigable globe.
And when, unpressed for time, they have leisurely
entered those slumbrous latitudes so anxiously
avoided by the hurried, worried merchantman,
how utterly have they neglected their marvellous
opportunities of observation of the wonders there
revealed. It may not be generally known that
during long-persisting calms the sea surface changes
its character. From limpid blue it becomes greasy
and pale, from that health-laden odour to which
the gratified nostrils dilate, and the satisfied lungs
expand, there is a gruesome change to an unwholesome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
stench of stagnation and decaying things,
such as the genius of Coleridge depicted when he
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The very deep did rot; O Christ!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the slimy sea.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Strangest of all the strange visitors to the upper
world at such times is the gigantic squid, or cuttle-fish.
Of all the Myriad species of mollusca this
monster may fairly claim chief place, and neither
in ancient or modern times have any excited more
interest than he. Gazing with childlike fear upon
his awe-inspiring and uncanny bulk, the ancients
have done their best to transmit their impressions
to posterity. Aristotle writes voluminously upon
the subject, as he did about most things, but his
cuttles are such as are known to most of us. Pliny
leaves on record much concerning the Sepiadæ
which is evidently accurate in the main, mentioning
especially (lib. ix. caps. iv. and xxx.) one monster
slain on the coast of Spain which was in the habit of
robbing the salt-fish warehouses. Pliny caused the
great head to be sent to Lucullus, and states that it
filled a cask of fifteen amphoræ. Its arms were
thirty feet long, so thick that a man could hardly
embrace them at their bases, and provided with
suckers, or acetabula, as large as basins holding
four or five gallons. But those who have leisure
and inclination may pursue the subject in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
works of Ælian, Paulinus (who describes the
monster as a gigantic crab), Bartholinus, Athanasius
Kircher, Athenæus, Olaus Magnus, and others.
Pontoppidan, Bishop of Bergen, in his <cite>Natural
History of Norway</cite>, has done more than any
other ancient or modern writer to discredit reports,
essentially truthful, by the outrageous fabrications
he tells by way of embellishment of the facts which
he received. Least trustworthy of all, he has been
in this connection most quoted of all, but here he
shall be mentioned only to hold his inventions up
to the scorn they so richly deserve.</p>

<p>The gigantic squid is, unlike most of the cephalopoda,
a decapod, not an octopod, since it possesses,
in addition to the eight branchiæ with
which all the family are provided, two tentacula of
double their length, having acetabula only in a
small cluster at their ends. This fact was noticed
by Athanasius Kircher, who describes a large
animal seen in the Sicilian seas which had <em>ten</em> rays,
or branches, and a body equal in size to that of a
whale; which, seeing how wide is the range in size
among whales, is certainly not over-definite.
Coming down to much later days, we find Denys
de Montfort <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">facile princeps</i> in his descriptions of
the Kraken (<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Hist. Nat. de Molluscs</cite>, tome ii.
p. 284). Unfortunately, his reputation for truthfulness
is but so-so, and he is reported to have
expressed great delight at the ease with which he
could gull credulous people. Still the best of his
stories may be quoted, remembering that, as far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
as his description of the monster is concerned, he
does not appear to have exaggerated at all.</p>

<p>He records how he became acquainted with a
master mariner of excellent repute, who had made
many voyages to the Indies for the Gothenburg
Company, by name Jean Magnus Dens. To this
worthy, sailing his ship along the African coast,
there fell a stark calm, the which he, even as
do prudent shipmasters to-day, turned to good
account by having his men scrape and cleanse the
outside of the vessel, they being suspended near
the water by stages for that purpose. While thus
engaged, suddenly there arose from the blue
placidity beneath a most “awful monstrous,”
cuttle-fish, which threw its arms over the stage,
and seizing two of the men, drew them below the
surface. Another man, who was climbing on
board, was also seized, but after a fearful struggle
his shipmates succeeded in rescuing him. That same
night he died in raving madness. The mollusc’s
arms were stated to be at the base of the bigness
of a fore-yard (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vergue d’un mât de misaine</i>), while
the suckers were as large as ladles (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cueillier à pot</i>).</p>

<p>One who should have done better—Dr. Shaw,
in his lectures—calmly makes of that “fore-yard”
a “mizen-mast,” and of the “ladles” “pot-lids,”
which may have been loose translation, even as the
scraping “<em>gratter</em>” is funnily rendered “raking,”
as if the ship’s bottom were a hayfield, but looks
uncommonly like editorial expansion, which the
story really does not require.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>Another story narrated by Denys de Montfort
relates how a vessel was attacked by a huge
“poulp,” which endeavoured to drag down vessel
and all; but the crew, assisted by their patron, St.
Thomas, succeeded in severing so many of the
monster’s arms from his body that he was fain to
depart, and leave them in peace. In gratitude
for their marvellous deliverance they caused an
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex voto</i> picture to be painted of the terrible scene,
and hung in their parish church, for a testimony
to the mighty power of the saint.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Phil. Trans.</cite> of the Royal Society (lxviii.
p. 226), Dr. Schewediawer tells of a sperm whale
being hooked (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sic</i>) which had in its mouth a
tentaculum of the Sepia Octopodia, twenty-seven
feet long. This was not its entire length, for one
end was partly digested, so that when <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i> it
must have been a great deal longer. When we
consider, says the learned doctor, the enormous
bulk of the animal to which the tentaculum here
spoken of belonged, we shall cease to wonder at
the common saying of sailors that the cuttle-fish
is the largest in the ocean.</p>

<p>In Figuier’s <cite>Ocean World</cite> he quotes largely
from Michelet, that great authority on the
Mollusca, giving at length the latter’s highly
poetical description of the vast family of “murderous
suckers,” as he terms the cephalopoda.</p>

<p>In the same work, too, will be found a most
matter-of-fact description and illustration of the
meeting of the French corvette <i>Alecton</i> with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
immense calamary between Teneriffe and Madeira.
This account was furnished by Lieutenant Bayer
to the Académie des Sciences, and is evidently a
sober record of fact. The monster’s body was
hauled alongside, and an attempt was made to
secure it by means of a hawser passed round it,
but of course, as soon as any strain was put upon
the rope, it drew completely through the soft
gelatinous carcass, severing it in two. The length
of this creature’s body was fifty feet. But M.
Figuier is not satisfied; he says that even this
account must be taken <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cum grano salis</i>, so unwilling
is he to believe in a monster that would
evidently settle the great Kraken and sea-serpent
question once for all.</p>

<p>Even Dr. Solander and Mr. Banks, after finding
a cuttle six feet long floating upon the sea near
Cape Horn, which was quite beyond all their
previous experience, could not bring themselves
to believe in the existence of any larger. So at
the beginning of this century, while people had
largely consented to accept the sea-serpent, they
would have none of the Kraken or anything which
might reasonably explain the persistence of evidence
about him. But had these scientific sceptics only
taken the trouble to interview the crews of the
South Sea whalers, that sailed in such a goodly
fleet from our ports during the first half of the
century, they must have been convinced that, so
far from the Kraken being a myth, he is one of
the most substantial of facts, unless, indeed, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
believed that all whalemen were in a conspiracy
to deceive them on that point.</p>

<p>Any thoughtful observer who has ever seen
a school of sperm whales, numbering several
hundreds, and understood, from the configuration
of their jaws, that they must of necessity feed
upon large creatures, can never after feel difficulty
in believing that, in order to supply the enormous
demand for food made by these whales, their prey
must be imposing in size and abundant in quantity.</p>

<p>On my first meeting with the cachalot, on
terms of mutual destruction, I knew nothing of
his habits, and cared less. But seeing him, when
wounded, vomiting huge masses of white substance,
my curiosity was aroused, and when I saw that
these masses were parts of a mighty creature
almost identical in structure with the small squid
so often picked up on deck, where it falls in its
frantic efforts to escape from dolphins (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Coryphæna</i>),
albacore, or bonito, my amazement was great.
Some of these fragments were truly heroic in size.</p>

<p>Surgeon Beale, in his book on the sperm whale,
only credits the cachalot with being able to swallow
a man, but with all the respect due to so great a
writer, I am bound to say that such masses as I
have seen ejected from the stomach of the dying
whale could only have entered a throat to which
a man was as a pill is to us. We can, however,
only speak of what we have seen, and perhaps Dr.
Beale had never seen such large pieces ejected.</p>

<p>In an article in <cite>Nature</cite> of June 4, 1896, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
have described an encounter which I witnessed
between a gigantic squid and a sperm whale, in
the Straits of Malacca, which, as far as I am
concerned, has settled conclusively the Kraken
and sea-serpent question for me. This terrific
combat took place under the full glare of a tropical
moon, upon the surface of a perfectly calm sea,
within a mile of the ship. Every detail of the
struggle was clearly visible through a splendid
glass, and is indelibly graven upon my mind. It
was indeed a battle of giants—perhaps all the
more solemnly impressive from being waged in
perfect silence. The contrast between the livid
whiteness of the mollusc’s body and the massive
blackness of the whale,—the convulsive writhing
of the tremendous arms, as, like a Medusa’s head
magnified a thousand times, they wound and
gripped about the columnar head of the great
mammal,—made a picture unequalled in all the
animal world for intense interest. The immense
eyes, at least a foot in diameter, glared out of the
dead white of the head, inky black, appalling in
their fixity of gaze. Could we have seen more
nearly, and in daylight, we should have also found
that the sea was turned from its normal blue into
a dusky brown by the discharge of the great
cephalopod’s reservoir of sepia, which in such a
creature must have been a tank of considerable
capacity. Each of those far-reaching arms were
of course furnished with innumerable sucking
discs, most of them a foot in diameter, and, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
addition to the adhering apparatus, provided with
a series of claws set round the inner edges of the
suckers, large as those of a grizzly bear. Besides
the eight arms, there were the two tentacula,
double the length of the arms, or over sixty feet
long—in fact, about the length of the animal’s
body, and quite worthy of being taken for a pair
of sea-serpents by themselves. But the whale
apparently took no heed of the Titanic struggles
of this enormous mollusc. He was busy wielding
his mighty jaws, not in mastication, but in
tearing asunder the soft flesh into convenient
lumps for being swallowed. All around were
numerous smaller whales or sharks, joining in the
plentiful feast, like jackals round a lion. Every
fisherman worth his salt knows how well all fish
that swim in the sea love the sapid flesh of the
cephalopoda, making it the finest bait known, and
in truth it is, and always has been, a succulent
dainty, where known, for mankind as well. But
it is evident from the scanty number of times that
the gigantic cuttle-fish has been reported, that
his habitat is well beneath the surface, yet not so
far down but that he may be easily reached by
the whale, and also find food for his own vast
bulk. Probably they prey upon one another.
From what we know of the habits of those
members of the family who live in accessible
waters, it is evident that nothing comes amiss to
them in the way of fish or flesh, dead or alive.</p>

<p>The Prince of Monaco, who is a devotee of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
marine natural history, was fortunate enough to
witness some bay whalers at Terceira early this
year catching a sperm whale. He and his
scientific assistants were alike amazed at seeing
the contents of the whale’s stomach ejected before
death, but their amazement became hysterical
delight when they found that the ejecta consisted
of portions of huge cuttle-fish, as yet unknown to
scientific classification. The species was promptly
named after the Prince, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Lepidoteuthis Grimaldii</i>,
and a paper prepared and read before the Académie
des Sciences at Paris. So profoundly impressed
was the Prince with what he had seen, that he at
once determined to convert his yacht into a whaler,
in order to become better acquainted with these
wonderful creatures, so long known to the obtuse
and careless whale-fishers. One interesting circumstance
noted by the Prince was the number of
circular impressions made upon the tough and
stubborn substance of the whale’s head, hard as
hippopotamus hide, showing the tremendous power
exerted by the mollusc as well as his inability to
do the whale any harm.</p>

<p>But were I to describe in detail the numerous
occasions upon which I have seen, not certainly
the entire mollusc, but such enormous portions of
their bodies as would justify estimating them as
fully as large as the whales feeding upon them, it
would become merely tedious repetition.</p>

<p>As I write, comes the news that an immense
squid has just been found stranded on the west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
coast of Ireland, having arms thirty feet in length,
a formidable monster indeed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be interesting to know
that these molluscs progress, while undisturbed,
literally on their heads, with all the eight arms
which surround the head acting as feet as well as
hands to convey food to the ever-gaping mouth;
but when moving quickly, as in flight, or to attack,
they eject a stream of water from an aperture in
the neck, which drives them backwards at great
speed, all the arms being close together. Close
to this aperture is the intestinal opening, a strange
position truly. Strangest, perhaps, of all is the
manner in which some species grow, at certain
seasons, an additional tentacle, which, when complete,
becomes detached and floats away. In
process of time it finds a female, to which it clings,
and which it at once impregnates. It then falls
off, and perishes. It is probable that the animal
kingdom, in all its vast range, presents no stranger
method than this of the propagation of species.</p>

<span class="subhead">CONCERNING SHARKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Among</span> the most fascinating of natural history
studies, but withal one of the most difficult, is
that of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Squalidæ</i>, or shark family. The
plodding perseverance of German professors has
furnished students with an elaborate classification
of these singular creatures in all their known
genera, but of their habits little is really known.
A mass of fable has clustered round them, much
of it surviving from very remote times, and added
to periodically by people who might, if they would,
know better. The reiteration of shark stories has
in consequence resulted in more ignorant prejudice
against the really useful <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">squalus</i> than has perhaps
fallen to the lot of any other animal, although
most observant people know how absurd are many
of the popular beliefs about much better known
creatures. Strangely enough, the detestation in
which the shark is generally held is largely the
fault of sea-farers. It never seems to occur to
shore-going folk how few are the opportunities
obtained by the ordinary sailor-man of studying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
the manners and customs of the marine fauna.
Merchant ships, even sailing vessels, must “make
a passage” in order to pay, and, except when
unfortunate enough to get becalmed for a long
spell, are rarely in a position favourable to close
observation of deep-sea fishes and their ways.
Men-of-war, especially surveying ships, who spend
much time in unfrequented waters, and are often
stationary for weeks at a time, are in a much
better plight, and give the eager student of marine
natural history great facilities for closely watching
the sea-folk. Yet those are seldom taken advantage
of as they might be for the rectification
of the abundant errors that are to be found in
books that deal in a popular way with the life-histories
of sea-monsters. The only class of
mariners who have had, so to speak, the home
life of the sea-people completely open to them,
who for periods of time extending to three or
four years were in daily contact with the usually
hidden sources of oceanic lore, were the South Sea
whalers, whose calling is now almost a thing of
the past. But even they wasted their invaluable
privileges most recklessly, the contributions which
they have made to science being exceedingly trivial.</p>

<p>Thus it comes about that the very men who
should have either verified or disproved the really
stupid stories current concerning sharks have
chosen instead to adopt them blindly, and have,
therefore, for centuries been guilty of the most
revolting cruelty towards these strange fish. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
this connection it is interesting to note the remote
times in which shark legends arose. Aristotle,
whose multifarious researches extended into so
many fields of knowledge, furnishes us with almost
the first recorded mention of the shark, and his
designation of them is perpetuated in the scientific
nomenclature of a very numerous species to-day,
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Lamiæ</i>. From another name for the same
creature πρίστις, we get <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pristiophoridæ</i>, or saw-fish,
a curious shark confounded by an enormous
number of otherwise well-read people with swordfish
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Xiphias</i>), which is really a huge mackerel
with a keen bony elongation of the upper jaw.
Lycophron has recorded that Hercules, in the
course of his superhuman adventures, was swallowed
by a shark (Κάρχαρος), in whose maw he remained
for three nights (why not days as well?), thence
being surnamed Trinox, or Trihesperides. Theophrastus,
pupil of Aristotle and Plato, observes
that the Red Sea abounds with sharks, a remark
which is as true in our day as it was in his.
The Hercules myth was doubtless founded upon
the reports of some actual witnesses of the
voracious habits of these insatiable monsters,
magnified and distorted, as most natural events
were in those days, by superstitious terror. Even
down to the present year of grace most people
believe that quite a moderate-sized <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">squalus</i> is
capable of swallowing a man entire, in spite of the
abundant ocular evidence to the contrary afforded
them by the specimens in museums, whose jaws,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
generally denuded of flesh, give a greater idea of
their capacity than is warranted by the living
creature. It is refreshing to find, however, that
even in those dark ages for all kinds of animals
such a judicial writer as Plutarch speaks a good
word for this universally feared and detested fish.
He says that in parental fondness, in suavity
and amiability of disposition, the shark is not
excelled by any other creature. Keen as is my
desire to see tardy justice awarded to the shark, I
should hesitate to endorse the eminent Greek’s
statement as far as the last two qualities are
concerned. My long and close acquaintance
with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Squalidæ</i> does not furnish me with any
evidence in their favour on either of these heads.
But in parental affection they are only equalled by
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cetacea</i>, no other fish having, as far as I am
aware, any reluctance to devour its own offspring.
Plutarch’s testimony, however, speaks volumes for
his powers of observation and courage of his
opinions, for verily in it he is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">contra mundum</i>.
Oppian, having seen the body of a huge shark in
the museum at Naples, voices in his fifth <cite>Halieutic</cite>
the general feeling in his day by the following
remarkable outburst: “May the earth which I
now feel under me, and which has hitherto
supplied my daily wants, receive, when I yield it,
my latest breath. Preserve me, O Jupiter!
from such perils as this, and be pleased to accept
my offerings to thee from dry land. May no thin
plank interpose an uncertain protection between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
me and the boisterous deep. Preserve me, O
Neptune! from the terrors of the rising storm,
and may I not, as the surge dashes over the deck,
be ever cast out amidst the unseen perils that
people the abyss. ’Twere punishment enough
for a mortal to be tossed about unsepulchred on
the waves, but to become the pasture of a fish, and
to fill the foul maw of such a ravenous monster as
I now behold, would add tenfold to the horrors of
such a lot.”</p>

<p>Olaus Magnus, upon whom we may always
depend for something startling and original both
in prose and picture, exhibits to our wondering
gaze an agonised swimmer rising half out of the
sea with three ravenous dog-fish hanging to him
as hounds to a stag. In the distance is a huge ray
or skate (one of the same family, by the by) with
a human face, intended probably for a kind of sea
angel, towards which wondrous apparition the
despairing wretch stretches forth his appealing
arms. Coming down to mediæval times, Rondolet
babbles of a shark, taken at Marseilles, in whose
stomach was discovered the body of a man in
complete armour, a tough morsel to swallow in
more senses than one. He also tells of a shark
accidentally stranded near the same port and lying
upon the shore with mouth wide gaping. Into
this inviting portal there entered a man accompanied
by a dog. The venturesome pair roamed
about the darksome cavern making all sorts of
strange discoveries, finally emerging into the outer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
air swelling with importance at having accomplished
so curious a feat. Enlarging upon this most
obvious “yarn,” the learned Dr. Badham gravely
remarks that it greatly strengthens the probability
that the fish which swallowed Jonah was a shark
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Piscis anthropophagus</i>), but that he is quite
certain it could not have been a whale, from the
well-known smallness of the latter’s gullet. Without
commenting upon the Old Testament story,
there can be no doubt whatever that in the
cachalot, or sperm whale, we have a marine
monster capable of swallowing Jonah and his
companions of Tarshish at a gulp—I had almost
said ship and all, such is the capacity of that vast
cetacean’s throat. But Dr. Badham, while posing
as an eminent authority, further exposes his
bountiful want of acquaintance with his subject by
observing that the liver of a medium-sized shark
will yield two tons and a half of oil! As it is a
huge shark that will scale that much altogether, he
must have imagined them to be even better
supplied with liver than Mulvaney’s hepatic
Colonel—in fact, all liver and some over.</p>

<p>A very favourite shark fable is to the effect
that these fish prefer negroes to Europeans as food.
The inventor of this was probably Père Labat, a
mediæval French li—, I mean historian. After enlarging
upon it for awhile he proceeds to embellish
it with the addition that the shark prefers Englishmen
to Frenchmen, because their flesh is more sapid
and juicy from being better nourished. That was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
probably before the French acquired their reputation
for cookery. Numberless variants of this
fantastic fable are extant, all, without exception, as
baseless as the original yarn from which they
have lineally descended. The annals of the slave-trade
have, as might be expected, produced a
plentiful crop of shark stories, of which apparently
only the untrue ones survive. It may perhaps be
true that the fiendish flesh dealers on the “West
Coast” really did surround themselves with a
cordon of slaves when they went bathing in the
sea, having relays ready to supply the places of
those occasionally snatched away by the sharks.
Highly improbable though, since it would have
been so expensive. Little doubt can attach to the
supposition that, with their instinct for offal so
marvellously developed as it is, great numbers of
sharks followed the slave-ships across the seas, from
whose pestilential holds the festering corpses were
daily flung. But when Pennant tells us that the
slaving captains used to hang the body of a slave
from yard-arm or bowsprit-end that they might be
amused by the spectacle of sharks leaping twenty
feet out of the sea and tearing the bodies to
fragments, he is stating that which is not only
grotesquely untrue, but manifestly absurd. Sharks
do not leap out of water. In making this statement
I am liable to be contradicted, as I have been before
in the columns of the <i>Spectator</i>, but never, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nota bene</i>,
except upon hearsay, or personal evidence that had
grave elements of doubt about it. Sharks can of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
course raise their bodies <em>partly</em> out of water by an
upward rush, a supreme effort rarely made by a
naturally and habitually sluggish fish; but, after an
experience among many thousands of sharks under
the most varied conditions in all parts of the world
where they abound, I repeat emphatically that it is
impossible for a shark to raise his entire body out
of water and seize anything suspended in the air.
And anyone who has carefully watched one shark
seizing anything in the water or on the surface will
find it difficult to disagree with me.</p>

<p>One more “authority” and we will get to firsthand
facts. Sir Hans Sloane, in a very particular
account of the shark, remarkable in many respects
for its accuracy, perpetrates the following:—“It
has several ducts on the head filled with a sort of
gelly, from which, being pressed by the water,
issues an unctuous, <em>viscid</em>, slippery, and mucilaginous
matter, very proper to make the fish very glib
to sail the readier through the water. Most fish
have something analagous to this.” That any fish
should secrete a lubricant, at once unctuous and
viscid, for the purpose of accelerating its progress
through the limpid element in which it lives, would
be curious indeed were such a contradictory fact
possible, but that Sir Hans Sloane should say so,
when the most cursory acquaintance with his
subject would have shown him the absurdity of
such a statement, would be far stranger were it not
for the evidence afforded by the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> of the
wildest flights of imagination on the part of savants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
even down to comparatively recent times. But
probably enough space has been given to ancient
fables about the shark.</p>

<p>The whole family of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Squalidæ</i>, with the
doubtful exceptions of the saw-fish (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pristiophoridæ</i>)
and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Raiidæ</i>, or skates, are scavengers, eaters of
offal. As such their functions, though humble,
are exceedingly useful and important; for although
the myriads of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Crustacea</i> are scavengers pure and
simple, their united efforts would be ineffectual to
keep the ocean breadths free from the pollution of
putrefying matter, since the vast majority of them
dwell upon the bottom of comparatively shallow
waters. Now when the body of some immense
sea-monster, such as a whale, is bereft of life and
rapidly rots, it usually floats. Then the office of
the sharks is at once apparent. The only large
fish that feeds upon garbage, they are possessed of
an enormous appetite, as well as a digestive
apparatus that would put to shame that of the
ostrich, who is popularly credited with a liking
for such dainties as nails and broken glass for <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors
d’œuvres</i>. The shark is ever hungry, and nothing,
living or dead, comes amiss to his maw; but owing
to the peculiar shape and position of his mouth it
is only in rare instances that he is able to catch living
prey, as, for instance, when the dog-fish of our
coasts, a common species of shark hated by fishermen,
gets among the nets enclosing a fine catch of
herring or mackerel. Then the gluttonous rascal
is in for a good time. Heedless of the flimsy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
barrier of twine, he gorges to bursting-point upon
the impounded school, and usually concludes his
banquet by tearing great gaps in the net, incidentally
allowing the rest of the prisoners to escape.
It is therefore hardly a matter for surprise that the
despoiled and exasperated toilers of the sea, when
they do succeed in capturing a dog-fish, should
wreak summary vengeance upon him by such
fantastic mutilation as their heated fancy suggests.
They have also some curious ideas that the erratic
antics performed by a blind, finless, and broken-jawed
dog-fish will frighten away his congeners;
and, as the shark is almost universally disdained as
food, this practice of dismembering them and
returning them alive to the sea, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour encourager les
autres</i>, seems to the fishermen an eminently
satisfactory one. Unfortunately for their theory,
the fact is, that supposing a sound and vigorous
shark to meet with one of his kind incapable of
flight or fight, the hapless flounderer would be
promptly devoured by his relative, doubtless with
the liveliest gratification. The shark has no
scruples or preferences. Whatever he can get
eatable (from his liberal point of view) he eats: of
necessity, since he bears within him so fierce a
craving for food that he will continue to devour
even when disembowelled, until even his tremendous
vitality yields to such a wound as that. Hence his
bad name as a devourer of human flesh. An
ordinary man in the water is, as a rule, the most
defenceless of animals; and even a strong swimmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
is apt to become paralysed with fear at the mere
rumour of a shark being in his vicinity. If there
be no shelter near, his nerveless limbs refuse their
office, he floats or sinks with hardly a struggle, and
the ravenous <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">squalus</i> finds in him not only an easy
prey, but no doubt a most savoury morsel. This
is no reason for suggesting that the shark prefers
the flesh of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">homo sapiens</i> to all other provender.
As I have already said, his tastes are eclectic. Nay,
it is highly doubtful whether he has any sense of
taste at all. All experiences point to the contrary,
for it is common knowledge that sharks will gobble
up anything thrown overboard from a ship, from a
corpse swathed in canvas to a lump of coal. This
omnivorousness has been noticed in an able article
published in <cite>Chambers’s Journal</cite> many years ago,
the writer putting forward as a plausible reason for
it the number of parasites that infest the stomachs
of these fish. In this, however, they are by no
means singular, all fish harbouring a goodly number
of these self-invited boarders, the shark certainly
entertaining no more than the average.</p>

<p>The presence of any large quantity of easily
obtainable food is always sufficient to secure the
undivided attention of the shark tribe. When
“cutting in,” whales at sea I have often been
amazed at the incredible numbers of these creatures
that gather in a short space of time, attracted by
some mysterious means from heaven only knows
what remote distances. It has often occurred to
us, when whaling in the neighbourhood of New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
Zealand, to get a sperm whale alongside without a
sign of a shark below or a bird above. Within an
hour from the time of our securing the vast mass
of flesh to the ship the whole area within at least
an acre has been alive with a seething multitude of
sharks, while from every airt came drifting silently
an incalculable host of sea-birds, converting the
blue surface of the sea into the semblance of a
plain of new-fallen snow. The body of a whale
before an incision is made in the blubber presents
a smooth rounded surface, almost as hard as
india-rubber, with apparently no spot where any
daring eater could find tooth-hold. But, oblivious
of all else save that internal anguish of desire, the
ravening sea-wolves silently writhed in the density
of their hordes for a place at the bounteous feast.
Occasionally one pre-eminent among his fellows
for enterprise would actually set his lower jaw
against the black roundness of the mighty carcass,
and, with a steady sinuous thrust of his lithe tail,
gouge out therefrom a mass of a hundredweight or
so. If he managed to get away with it, the space
left presented a curious corrugated hollow, where
the serrated triangular teeth had worried their way
through the tenacious substance, telling plainly
what vigorous force must have been behind them.
But it was seldom that we permitted such premature
toll to be taken of our spoil. The
harpooners and officers from their lofty position on
the cutting stage slew scores upon scores by simply
dropping their keen-edged blubber spades upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
the soft crowns of the struggling fish, the only
place where a shark is vulnerable to instant death.
The weapon sinks into the creature’s brain, he
gives a convulsive writhe or two, releases his hold
and slowly sinks, followed in his descent by a
knot of his immediate neighbours, all anxious to
provide him with prompt sepulture within their
own yearning maws.</p>

<p>At such a time as this the presence of a man in
the water, right in the midst of the hungry host,
passes unnoticed by them as long as he is upon
the surface and in motion. Among the islands,
while engaged in the “humpbacked” whale fishery,
the natives were continually in and out of the
water alongside where the sharks swarmed innumerable,
but we never saw or heard of one
being bitten. And some of <em>those</em> sharks were of
the most enormous dimensions—approaching a
length of thirty feet and of a bulk almost equal
to one of our whale-boats. With that unerring
instinct for spoil characteristic of the sharks, they
begin to congregate in these seas almost contemporaneously
with an attack upon a whale by
whale-fishers. Now, one of the most frequent
experiences in this perilous trade is that of a
“stove” boat, necessitating a subsequent sojourn
in the sea unprotected—sometimes for hours.
Under such circumstances—and they have many
times fallen to my share—I am free to confess
that I have always had a curious feeling about my
legs as if they were much too long, and whenever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
anything touched them a sympathetic thrill of
apprehension would run up my spine; but my
legs are still of the usual length. Nor did I ever
hear of a man being attacked in the water at such
times. In fact, it is an article of faith with whalemen
that sharks have sufficient intelligence to know
that the human hunters of the whale are busily
providing a feast for them, and that therefore a
truce is then rigidly observed between them; for,
although the ravenous creatures cannot refrain
from attempting to sample the blubber <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i>,
their opportunity arrives when the mountainous
mass of reeking meat, stripped of its external
coating of fat, is cut adrift from the ship’s side
and allowed to float away. Then do they attack
it in their thousands, and in an incredibly short
time reduce it to a cleanly picked skeleton, for
even their prowess is not equal to devouring the
enormous framework of bone. But what they are
capable of in the way of feeding may be judged
from the fact that a humpbacked whale of about
eighty tons in weight, which sank, after we had
killed him, in about ten fathoms of water and
which we were unable to raise for six hours for
want of suitable gear, was so reduced in size by
the time we lifted him to the surface again as not
to be worth towing to the ship. In those latitudes,
<i>i.e.</i> among the South Pacific Islands, are, I believe,
to be found the largest sharks in the world,
certainly the largest of those voracious kinds that
so ably fill the office of sea-scavengers. Very large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
specimens of the basking shark, some nearly thirty
feet long and of much greater girth than the
ordinary ones, have been found in our own seas,
but these unwieldy creatures are as harmless as
whales, and quite as timid. There is a very
circumstantial account in <cite>Nature</cite> of several years
ago of a curious shark caught at Taboga Island,
Gulf of Panama, by the crew of the Royal Italian
corvette <i>Vettor Pisani</i>. When accurately measured
it was found to be 8.9 metres long, and its greatest
girth 6.5 metres. The mouth of this monster
was at the point of its snout instead of beneath it,
but the teeth were rudimentary and covered with
membrane. So harmless was it that it afforded
harbourage within its mouth to several <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Remora</i>,
a curious hanger-on of the shark family, of whom
more presently. Dr. Günther classifies this very
queer fish as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rhinodon typicus</i>. Sharks of the
size I have mentioned as abounding in the South
Pacific have often seven rows of teeth ranked
behind each other. Only the first row were erect,
the others lay flat as if ready to replace a sudden
loss of those in use. But, after watching their
operations upon pieces of “kreng,” I am bound
to say that swallowing a man whole, even by the
largest of them, appears to me an utterly impossible
feat.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of the shark is that their
colossal bodies are built upon a framework of
cartilage, not bone. This may possibly account
for their complete recovery from the most fundamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
injuries. I once caught an eight-feet-long
shark in the North Atlantic whose appearance
suggested nothing out of the common. But,
having a desire to make one of those useless
articles dear to sailors, a walking-stick of a shark’s
backbone, I went to the trouble of extracting the
spine. I found to my amazement that in the
middle of it there was not only a solid mass of
bone of over a foot long, but it was at this place
quite double the normal thickness. Further investigation
revealed the fact that at some period
of his career this creature had been transfixed by a
harpoon which had torn out, nearly severing his
body in two halves. Several of the ribs were
re-knit and thickened in the same way. This
splendid recuperative power renders the shark
almost invulnerable, except, as before noticed, to
a direct severing of the brain, or such a radical
dismemberment as lopping off the tail.</p>

<p>Slothfulness is a distinctive feature of all the
sharks. They are able to put on a spurt at times,
but want of energy characterises them all. This
habit reaches its climax in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Remora</i>, to which
allusion has already been made. As if in pursuance
of a widely held opinion that lazy people are the
most prolific inventors, this small <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">squalus</i> has
evolved an arrangement on the top of his head
whereby he can attach himself to any floating
body and be carried along without effort on his
part. All the functions are easily performed
during attachment, and nothing short of doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
damage to the fish will dislodge him. It is fairly
well known that the Chinese and East African
folk have utilised the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Remora</i> for catching turtle in
a most ingenious way. More energetic than any
other sharks are the saw-fish, whose snouts are
prolonged into a broad blade of cartilage, which is
horizontal when the fish is swimming in a normal
position, and has both its edges set with slightly
curved teeth about an inch apart. The end of
this formidable-looking weapon is blunt and
comparatively soft, so that it is quite incapable of
the feats popularly attributed to it of piercing
whales’ bodies, ships’ timbers, etc. It attacks
other fish by a swift lateral thrust of the saw
beneath them, the keen edge disembowelling them.
Then it feeds upon the soft entrails, which are
apparently the only food it can eat, from the
peculiar shape of its mouth. It has an enormous
number of small teeth, sometimes as many as
fifty rows in one individual, but they are evidently
unfit for the rough duties required of teeth by the
garbage-eating members of the family.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity which differentiates the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Squalidæ</i> from all other fish, and would seem to
link them with the mammalia, is the way in which
they produce their young. But here arise such
diversities as to puzzle the student greatly; for
some sharks are viviparous, bearing fifteen sharklets
at once, that play about the mother in the liveliest
manner, and are cared for by her with the utmost
solicitude. At the approach of danger they all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
rush to the parent and hurry down her throat,
hiding in some snug chamber till their alarm has
subsided, when they emerge again and immediately
recommence their gambols. The pretty little blue
and gold <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Caranx</i> (pilot-fish) that is so faithful a
friend and companion to the shark also hides at
times in the same capacious retreat. That this is
a fact cannot be disputed, since sharks have often
been caught and cut open, and the lively prisoners
taken from within. Upon several occasions I
have witnessed this, and I once kept a family of
a dozen for over a week in a tub of water, feeding
them on scraps, until some busybody gave them to
the cat and made her very unwell. I have also
seen the young ones and the pilot left behind
when a shark has been caught, their frantic
leapings upward at their departing protector being
quite a moving sight. Other sharks are ovoviviparous,
laying eggs over the hatching of which
they watch and afterwards care for the young as
tenderly as do the others. Another species pack
their eggs in a sort of pouch as the skates
do. This envelope contains all the nourishment
necessary to the well-being of the young until
they are able to provide for themselves, but the
parent has no further concern with them. As
instances of the intelligence of the shark many
well-authenticated stories might be told did space
permit, but two must suffice. While lying in the
harbour of Tamatave every device we could
conceive was put in practice in order to catch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
some of the sharks with which those waters
abounded, but none were successful, for they
carefully avoided all bait attached to lines strong
enough to hold them. And the well-known habit
of the “thresher” shark (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Alopecias vulpes</i>), of
hunting with the killer-whale (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Orca gladiator</i>),
assisting these furies to destroy a whale and
afterwards amicably dividing the spoil with them,
has been enlarged upon many times. Its absolute
certainty does not admit of a doubt.</p>

<span class="subhead">FLYING-FISH CATCHING AT
BARBADOS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Among</span> the many divers methods of garnering
the harvest of the sea, one of the most interesting
and peculiar is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Exocetus</i> fishery of Barbados.
Notwithstanding the incredible numbers of Flying-fish
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Exocetus volitans</i>) that crowd every tropical
sea, Barbados is the only place where a systematic
fishery of them has ever been established for commercial
purposes. This is the more strange when
the ease with which they may be taken, and the
pleasant conditions under which the fishery is
carried on, is considered, while the succulent delicacy
of the fish is certainly a thing to remember.
Familiar as the appearance of these wonderful little
creatures is to ocean travellers, very little is generally
known with regard to their habits, haunts, and
mode of life. They are usually the recipients of
much misspent pity. Relentlessly pursued by the
albacore, bonito, and dolphin, they seek the air in
shoals, only to be gaily annexed by hovering birds,
or to fall gasping upon the deck of some passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
ship. Their fate seems a hard one; but who
pities their prey? They in their turn pursue
as relentlessly and persecute as ruthlessly the
smaller fish; and so the balance is held as truly
as nature ever holds it where man does not
interfere.</p>

<p>The most common and widely distributed
variety of the flying-fish is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">E. volitans</i>, whose
range is world-wide between the limits of about
thirty-five degrees north and thirty degrees south,
though they are most plentifully found within the
tropics. They are usually from six to twelve inches
in length, body nearly quadrangular, colour of the
head and back blue, abdomen silvery, lower lobe
of the tail one-half longer than the upper. Some
have no teeth, while others are well furnished;
and naturalists are unable to agree as to whether
they are different varieties, as they are in all other
respects identical. The pectoral fins, or wings as
they might well be called, are nearly as long as
the fish, folding neatly and compactly into the
sides of the body while the fish is in the water.
The ventral fins are small in this species, and do
not appear to be used as wings, merely serving
to balance and guide the fish in the air. A very
common error made in natural histories where
this fish is mentioned is in the statement that it
does not fly. “Its supposed flight is nothing more
than a prolonged leap; it cannot deviate from
a straight line, and cannot rise a second time
without entering the water.” This, briefly, is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
sort of thing one meets with in text-books where
reference is made to this fish.</p>

<p>The simplest way of dealing with it is the
Professor’s method of answering the query of the
French Academy whether their definition of a
crab was correct. The story is so well known
that it does not need repetition. As the result of
personal observation extending over a good many
years, I assert that the Exocetus <em>does fly</em>. I have
often seen a flying-fish rise two hundred yards
off, describe a semicircle, and meeting the ship,
rise twenty feet in the air, perpendicularly, at
the same time darting off at right angles to
its previous course. Then, after another long
flight, when just about to enter the water, the
gaping jaws of a dolphin emerging from the sea
gave it pause, and it rose again, returning almost
directly upon its former course. This procedure
is so common, that it is a marvel it has not been
more widely noticed. A flying-fish of mature size
can fly a thousand yards. It does not flap its fins
as a bird, but they vibrate, like the wings of an
insect, with a distinct hum. The only thing which
terminates its flight involuntarily is the drying of
its fin membranes, and their consequent stiffening.</p>

<p>A marvellous provision of nature is apparent
in the economy of this fish. Its swim-bladder
can be inflated so as to occupy the whole cavity
of the abdomen. Another membrane in the
mouth is inflated through the gills. These two
reservoirs of air form an excellent substitute for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
the air-cells within the bones of birds, and have
the additional advantage of being voluntary in
their action.</p>

<p>The only other species of flying-fish which is
sufficiently distinct to call for notice is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">E.
nigricans</i>, locally known as ‘Guineamen.’ They
often exceed eighteen inches in length, and weigh
two or three pounds. In these the ventral fins
are also very large, giving the fish the appearance
of a huge dragon-fly as it darts through the lucent
air. The markings of the body are black instead
of blue, while the fins are black with a transverse
band of silver.</p>

<p>Another strange thing about the natural histories
that I have been able to consult is that
no idea seems to be formed of where and how
these fish spawn. Being met with all over the
ocean, where its profound depth precludes all
idea of their visiting the bottom, the locality of
their breeding-places has puzzled the savants.
There can, however, be no doubt that they deposit
their ova in the massive banks of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sargasso
bacciferum</i>, or Gulf-weed, which is met with in
such vast quantities as to impede a vessel’s progress
through it. Through the pleasant groves
and avenues of these floating forests, the young
fry in millions disport in comparative security,
while finding abundant food among the myriad
lower forms of life that abound there. Of course,
this remark can only apply to the Atlantic. Not
having had opportunities enough of observation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
I am unable to say where they spawn in the other
oceans they frequent. On the coral reefs of the
Leeward Islands and the sandy cays of the
Caribbean Sea, I have often amused myself by
catching the young fry thrown up with piles of
Gulf-weed on the beach, and seen masses of the
spawn, like huge bunches of white currants,
entangled among its close-knit fronds.</p>

<p>Barbados, situated in the heart of the north-east
Trades, is one of the favourite haunts of the
flying-fish. Its steep shore-lines afford the blue
depths which the flying-fish loves, and permit it
to range very near to land. Thus the fishermen
rarely go more than ten or twelve miles from
home. When this industry was first commenced
by the Barbadians, or what led to its establishment,
I have been unable to discover; but it certainly
has been for many years the mainstay of a large
part of the population, and the source whence the
most popular food known on the island is derived.
There are (or were) about two hundred boats
engaged in the fishery. Nowise notable for grace
of form or elegance of rig, they are substantial
undecked vessels, of from five to fifteen tons
capacity, built in the roughest manner, and furnished
in the most primitive way. The motive
power is a gaff-mainsail and jib, and a couple of
sweeps for calms. They are painted a light blue,
as nearly approaching the hue of the sea as may
be, and every care is taken to make them noiseless.</p>

<p>The fleet leaves the “canash” (harbour) before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
daybreak, each skipper taking his own bearings,
and making for the spot which he thinks will
furnish the best results. As the gorgeous tropical
dawn awakes, the boats’ peaks are drooped, luffs
of sails are hauled up, and the fishermen get to
business. The tackle used is of the simplest kind.
A wooden hoop three feet in diameter, to which
is attached a shallow net with inch meshes; a
bucketful of—well, not to put too fine a point
on it—stinking fish; a few good lines and hooks,
and a set of granes, form the complete lay-out.
The fishermen are of all shades, from a deep rich
ebony upwards, by fine gradations, to the cadaverous
white so common in the island. Their simple
fishing costume is usually one sole garment—the
humble flour or potato sack of commerce,
with holes cut in the bottom and sides, through
which to thrust head and arms.</p>

<p>As soon as the boat is hove-to and her way
stopped, the usual exuberant spirits and hilarious
laughter are put and kept under strong restraint,
for a single sound will often scare away all fish
in the vicinity, and no more be seen that day.
The fisherman leans far over the boat’s side,
holding the hoop diagonally in one hand. The
other hand, holding one of the malodorous fish
before mentioned, is dipped into the sea, and the
bait squeezed into minute fragments. This
answers a double purpose—it attracts the fish;
and the exuding oil forms a “sleek” or glassy
surface all around, through which one can see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
to a great depth. Presently, sundry black specks
appear far down; they grow larger and more
numerous, and the motionless black man hanging
over the gunwale scarcely breathes. As soon
as a sufficient number are gathered, he gently
sweeps the net downwards and towards the boat
withal, bringing it to the surface by drawing it
up against the side. Often it will contain as
many fish as a man can lift; but so quietly and
swiftly is the operation performed, that the school
is not startled, and it very often happens that
a boat is filled (that is, seven or eight thousand
fish) from one school. More frequently, however,
the slightest noise, even a passing shadow, will alarm
the school; there is a flash of silvery light, and
the water is clear, not a speck to be seen. Sometimes
the fleet will return with not one thousand
fish among them, when prices will range very
high, until next day, when, with fifty or sixty
boats bringing five or six thousand each, a penny
will purchase a dozen.</p>

<p>Occasionally, in the midst of a good spell of
fishing, the school will vanish, and a crowd of
dolphin, albacore, or bonito make their appearance.
Then the sport changes its character.
Lines are hastily unrolled, a living flying-fish is
impaled on the hook and trolled astern, seldom
failing to allure an albacore or some other large
fish, varying perhaps from twenty to two hundred
pounds weight. On one occasion, when I had the
pleasure of a cruise in one of the boats, we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
very poor sport with the flying-fish, only taking
about five hundred by noon. Suddenly the few
that had been feeding quietly around us fled in all
directions, breaking the water with a sound like a
sudden rain-storm, and we were aware of the
presence of a huge albacore. The skipper shouted
gleefully: “By king, sah, him de bigges’ albacore
in de whol’ worl’.” He certainly was a monster;
but there was little time to admire his proportions.
He promptly seized our bait; and the fun commenced.
For over an hour this giant mackerel
towed us where he would; and when for a
moment the pace slackened and we touched the
line, he was off again as hard as ever. Right
through the fleet he towed us, and finally yielded
to our united efforts in the middle of Carlisle Bay,
amongst the shipping. We could not hoist him
on board, and so had recourse to the expedient of
passing a double bight of the line round his tail
and towing him into the harbour. Great was the
excitement on the quay, and willing hands not a
few worked the crane wherewith we lifted him.
He scaled four hundred and seventy pounds, the
heaviest albacore on record in Barbados. Peddled
around the town, he realised a much larger sum
than a boat-load of flying-fish would have done;
and so the sable skipper was well content with his
morning’s work.</p>

<span class="subhead">UNCONVENTIONAL FISHING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Enthusiastic</span> anglers have, I believe, been heard
to declare with emphasis that they would rather
catch no fish at all than return with a full creel
inveigled in an “unsportsmanlike” way. Of
course, ideas of what constitutes sport vary almost
with the individual, since like the rubric—(with
red edges, please)—sporting canons are susceptible
of private interpretation. But if the ultimate
object of fishing be the gratification of catching
fish, my stupidity baulks at the notion of an angler,
enthusiastic or stolid, preferring to be unsuccessful
rather than to succeed by the exercise of a little
personal ingenuity, whether it be unconventional
or canonical. What can be more pathetic, for
instance, than to see a perfectly-equipped sportsman,
whose outfit has made a terrible hole in a
£20 note, watching with simulated indifference
outwardly, but black envy clawing his liver, some
grimy urchin with string and stick grassing fish
after fish, while he is unable to get a rise?
Perhaps, however, my point of view is unfair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
because one-sided. For while it has many
hundreds of times been my lot to either catch
some fish or go without a meal, which certainly
quickened my interest in the sport, I have seldom
had the pleasure of fishing merely for amusement.
Although never a professional fisherman, and
therefore a hater of nets as reducing the joy or
success to the level of scavenging, I have from a
very early age, and in nearly every part of the
world washed by the sea, taken a hand at fishing
from deep personal motives, and always on
unconventional lines.</p>

<p>My first introduction to the stern delights of
sea-fishing was in a Jamaican harbour when I was
thirteen years old. Having been shipwrecked I
was for the time by way of being a juvenile beachcomber,
but I had plenty of good-natured darky
chums. Four of them took me out one day in
their canoe barracouta-fishing. Now this fish is a
sort of sea-pike which sometimes reaches four feet
in length, and for his fierceness is more dreaded
in the West Indies by bathers than the much
maligned shark. His principal food is small fish,
although he is not dainty. In order to imitate as
nearly as possible the flight of his usual prey, it is
customary for four darkies to man a canoe, get well
out to sea during the early morning calm, and then
paddle furiously for a few hundred yards at a time,
towing a small mackerel at the end of a stout line.
On this occasion I held the line. I thought it
glorious fun; but suddenly I saw a bar of silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
leap into the air, followed instanter by my sudden
exit from the canoe. I had a turn of the line
round my hand, a trick of inexperience. There
was a good deal of noise and excitement, during
which the dugout capsized and spilled her crew
around, while the big fish did his best to tow
the light craft away from us; but in some
mysterious scrambling fashion we all embarked
again. By this time the ’couter was very tired,
allowing us to haul him up alongside and take him
aboard quite peaceably. Then hey for the beach,
borrow a truck, and peddle the prize around
town at so much a pound. But they wouldn’t
take me any more.</p>

<p>A good deal of promiscuous fishing of an
unsatisfactory kind was added to my youthful
experiences before I reached home, some of it
only to be recalled with many pangs. After a
long, weary pull in the sweltering, tropical evenings,
to drop upon some ghoulish reef-spur and break
hook after hook in the rugged coral branches
until no more remained, and we must needs return
hungry and dispirited—these are not pleasant
things to remember. But the following year I
made my first long voyage, and on the passage
out got an experience that makes my finger-tips
tingle to-day. With envious eyes I had watched
the mate, as from the end of the flying jibboom
he had vainly tried to cozen some bonito (a sort
of exaggerated mackerel) that were accompanying
the ship into the belief that a shred of white rag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
with which he was flicking the water was a flying-fish.
Naturally, I burned to show that I could
succeed, and no sooner had he come in to take the
sun than I was out along the boom like a rat
to take his place. There was a fresh breeze
blowing, and as the ship heeled and plunged the
line blew far away to leeward in a graceful curve
which only permitted the rag to touch the wave-tops
occasionally. I trembled so with excitement
that I could not have kept my perch, but that my
legs were jammed in between the jib guys and the
boom. I had not been there more than five
minutes when a splendid fish sprang twenty feet
into the air and swallowed my bait on the wing.
I hauled for dear life, scarcely daring to look
below where my prize hung dangling, a weight
I could only just manage to pull up. But I
succeeded at last, and grabbed him to my panting
breast. There wasn’t time to get scared at the
contract I had on my hands; I just hung on
while his tremendous vibrations benumbed my body
so that I could not even feel that he was actually
chafing all the skin off my ribs. At last, feeling
my strength almost gone, I plunged him into the
folds of the flying-jib, which was furled on the
boom, and laid on him. In this way I succeeded
in overcoming his reluctance to stay with me, and
eventually I bore him on board in triumph, not
even dashed by the effective ropes-ending I got
for soaking the jib in blood from head to tack.
After that memorable capture I was simply crazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
with fishing. Even in calms, when predatory
fish such as dolphin, barracouta, bonito, or
albacore hang around listlessly and are considered
quite uncatchable by seamen generally, I have
managed to deceive them and obtain that great
desideratum, a fresh mess for all hands. But
coming home round the Cape, when in the strength
of the Agulhas current, the wind failed, and the
mate got out the deep-sea lead-line. In orthodox
fashion we passed it forrard and dropped the long
plummet into the dark depths, with two or three
stout hooks, baited with lumps of fat pork,
fastened to it. When we hauled it in each hook
was burdened with a magnificent cod, and a scene
of wild excitement ensued. All the watch
improvised tackle of some kind—a piece of
hambro’ line, a marlinespike for sinker, and one
hook was the usual outfit—and in a couple of
hours the deck was like Billingsgate. All sorts
and conditions of fish apparently lived down there,
and all most accommodating in their appetite.</p>

<p>In Manila Bay the natives taught me how to
catch a delicious fish like a more symmetrical
John Dory, with a most delicate line of twisted
grass and a tiny hook. The bait was rice, boiled
to a paste; and so successful was I that all hands
enjoyed a hearty supper of fish every evening,
being the only crew in the harbour where such
a thing was known. On that passage home,
however, I caught a Tartar. I was fishing off
the boom for bonito, when suddenly the school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
closed up into a compact body and fled. I
thought it strange, but went on playing my bait.
Suddenly out of the cool shade beneath the ship
rushed an albacore, grabbing my bait before I had
time to lift it out of his way. He wasn’t very large
for his kind, but my gracious, he was all I wanted.
I actually tried to haul him up at first, but I
couldn’t begin to lift him; so I was fain to play
him until we were both exhausted. He was
eventually secured at last by the simple expedient
of lowering a man overside who slipped a bowline
round him, by which he was hoisted on board.
He weighed 120 lb., but seemed as strong as a
buffalo. Some years after, when out flying-fishing
in Barbados one morning, we hooked an albacore
that towed our boat, a 5-tonner, for over six
miles before he gave in. We towed him alongside
into the carenage and had him hoisted on to
the wharf by a crane. He weighed 470 lb. The
albacore is almost, if not quite, identical with the
tunny of the Mediterranean and the tuna of
California, and anybody who thirsts for greater
sport than the noblest salmon can give, or even
the magnificent tarpon, should try what the tuna
can do for them.</p>

<p>But of all the queer fish I ever caught, one
that I came across in Tonala River, Mexico, was
the strangest. It was just inside the bar, and I
had been sailing the boat smartly to and fro,
catching a kind of caranx that loves a fleeting
silvery bait. Sport becoming quiet, and wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
falling, I packed about a pound of fish on my
largest hook and let it trail while I smoked the
cigarito of laziness. I hoped to get a good-sized
fish in this way before returning on board.
Suddenly my line tautened out, zip, zip—this was
no ordinary fish. After about twenty minutes
of thoroughly exhausting work I caught sight of
a dirty, brownish mass away down under water.
Redoubling my efforts, up came my fish—an
alligator ten feet long. He looked perfectly
devilish, and for the moment I was really scared.
Hooks were scarce, however, so calling upon the
darky with me to stand by with a running bowline,
I hauled away till I got his hideous snout up out of
the water, which I doubt whether I should have
done but that he came for me with a rush at the
last. Joe dropped the noose over his upper jaw
most neatly, getting it tightened between his ugly
yellow teeth so that he couldn’t bite it. Just then
a breeze sprang up, and making the rope fast to
a thwart we kept away for the ship, the great
saurian’s jaws banging against the boat’s planks and
ripping large splinters out of them. We got him
aboard safely, to find “he” was a female, with
over a bushel of eggs in her body and a strange
collection of rubbish in her stomach.</p>

<span class="subhead">DEVIL-FISH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Among</span> such primitive peoples as still survive, not
the least curious or notable trait which universally
obtains is the manner in which all things uncanny,
or which they are unable to comprehend, are by
common consent ascribed to the Devil. Not to
<em>a</em> devil as one of a host, but <em>the</em> Devil <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>,
as though they understood him to be definable
only as the master and originator of whatsoever
things are terrifying, incomprehensible, or cruel.
Many eminent writers have copiously enriched our
literature by their researches into this all-prevailing
peculiarity, so that the subject has, on the whole,
been well threshed out, and it is merely alluded
to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en passant</i> as one of the chief reasons for the
epithet which forms the title of this chapter.</p>

<p>Now it will doubtless be readily admitted that
sea-folk retain, even among highly civilised nations,
their old-world habits of thought and expression
longer than any other branch of the population.
This can scarcely be wondered at, since to all of
us, even the least imaginative, the eternal mystery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
of the ocean appeals with thrilling and ever-fresh
effect every time that we come into close personal
relations with it.</p>

<p>But when those whose daily bread depends
upon their constant struggle with the mighty
marine forces, who are familiar with so many of
its marvels, and saturated with the awe-inspiring
solemnity which is the chief characteristic of the
sea, are in the course of their avocations brought
suddenly in contact with some seldom-seen visitor
of horrent aspect arising from the gloomy unknown
depths, with one accord they speak of the monster
as a “devil-fish,” and the name never fails to adhere.</p>

<p>So that there is, not one species of devil-fish,
but several, each peculiar to some different part of
the world, and inspiring its own special terror in
the hearts of mariners of many nations. Of the
Devil-fish that we in this country hear most about,
and have indelibly portrayed for us by Victor Hugo,
the octopus, so much has been written and said
that it is not necessary now to do much more than
make passing allusion to the family. But the
Cephalopoda embrace so vast a variety that it seems
hardly fair to single out of them all the comparatively
harmless octopus for opprobrium, while
leaving severely unmentioned the gigantic <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">onychoteuthis</i>
of the deep sea, to say nothing of many
intermediate cuttle-fish. From the enormous
mollusc just mentioned—which is, not unreasonably,
credited by seamen with being the largest
fish in the ocean—to the tiny loligo, upon which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
nearly all deep-water fish feed, hideousness is their
prevailing feature, and truly appalling of aspect
some of the larger ones are, while their omnivorous
voracity makes them veritable sea-scavengers, to
whom nothing comes amiss, alive or dead. And
while having no intention to underrate the claims
of the octopus to his diabolical prænomen on
account of his slimy ugliness and unquenchable
ferocity, I feel constrained to put in a word for
that little-known horror of the deep, the ten-armed
cuttle-fish, which, like some fearful creation
of a diseased brain, broods over the dark and
silent profundities of ocean, extending his far-reaching
tentacles through an immense area, touching
nothing living to which they do not cling with
an embrace that never relaxes until the victim is
safely deposited within the crushing clutch of the
great parrot-like mandibles guarding the entrance
to that vast and never-to-be satisfied stomach.
Nothing that the morbid imagination of man has
ever pictured can surpass in awful appearance the
reality of this dire chimæra, which, notwithstanding,
has undoubtedly an important part to play in the
mysterious economy of the sea. “He dwelleth in
the thick darkness”; for, not content with the
natural gloom of his abode, he diffuses around
him a cloud of sepia, which bewilders and blinds
his victims, rendering them an easy prey to the
never-resting tentacles which writhe through the
mirk, ready at a touch to hold whatever is there,
be it small or great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>But the strangest fact connected with this
mighty mollusc is, that while from the earliest
dawn of literature numberless allusions more or
less tinged with imagination have been made to it,
modern science has only very recently made up its
mind to accept as a fact its existence at all. So
many indisputable proofs have, however, been
forthcoming of late years, both as to the size and
structure of the gigantic cuttle-fish, that it has
now taken its place among the verities of natural
history as indisputably as the elephant or the tiger.
It has also been firmly established that the sperm
whale or cachalot (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Physeter macrocephalus</i>) finds
his principal, if not his only, food in these huge
gelatinous masses while ranging the middle
depths of the ocean, and that their appearance
on the sea surface is generally due to this whale’s
aggression.</p>

<p>To pass on, however, to a much less known
“devil-fish.” In the long fish gallery at the
splendid Natural History Museum at South
Kensington there is a small specimen, some
eighteen inches across, of a fish whose habitat is
the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.</p>

<p>There it attains enormous proportions, and is,
not without reason, known to all the frequenters
of those waters as the “devil-fish.” When a
youngster I was homeward bound from Sant’ Ana
with a cargo of mahogany, and when off Cape
Campèche was one calm afternoon leaning over the
taffrail, looking down into the blue profound, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
the watch for fish. A gloomy shade came over
the bright water, and up rose a fearsome monster
some eighteen feet across, and in general outline
more like a skate or ray than anything else, all
except the head. There, what appeared to be two
curling horns about three feet apart rose one on
each side of the most horrible pair of eyes
imaginable. A shark’s eyes as he turns sideways
under your vessel’s counter and looks up to see if
any one is coming are ghastly, green, and cruel;
but this thing’s eyes were all these and much more.
I felt that the Book of Revelation was incomplete
without him, and his gaze haunts me yet.
Although quite sick and giddy at the sight of
such a bogey, I could not move until the awful
thing, suddenly waving what seemed like mighty
wings, soared up out of the water soundlessly to a
height of about six feet, falling again with a
thunderous splash that might have been heard for
miles. I must have fainted with fright, for the
next thing I was conscious of was awakening under
the rough doctoring of my shipmates. Since then
I have never seen one leap upward in the daytime.
At night, when there is no wind, the sonorous
splash is constantly to be heard, although why they
make that bat-like leap out of their proper element
is not easy to understand. It does not seem
possible to believe such awe-inspiring horrors
capable of playful gambolling.</p>

<p>At another time, while mate of a barque loading
in the Tonala River, one of the Mexican mahogany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
ports, I was fishing one evening from the vessel’s
deck with a very stout line and hook for large
fish.</p>

<p>A prowling devil-fish picked up my bait, and
feeling the hook, as I suppose, sprang out of water
with it. I am almost ashamed to say that I made
no attempt to secure the thing, which was a
comparatively small specimen, but allowed it to
amuse itself, until, to my great relief, the hook
broke, and I recovered the use of my line, my
evening’s sport quite spoiled.</p>

<p>These ugly monsters have as yet no commercial
value, although from their vast extent of flat
surface they might be found worthy of attention
for their skins, which should make very excellent
shagreen. A closer acquaintance with them would
also most probably divest them of much of the
terror in which they are held at present.</p>

<p>Another widely known and feared devil-fish has
its headquarters in the Northern Pacific, mostly
along the American coast, especially affecting the
Gulf of California. This huge creature is a
mammal, one of the great whale family, really a
rorqual of medium size and moderate yield of oil.
Like the rest of this much-detested and shunned
(by whalers) branch of the Cetacea, it carries but
a tiny fringe of valueless whalebone, and therefore,
as compared with the sperm and “right”
whales, its value is small. Yet at certain seasons
of the year the American whaleships often think it
worth their while to spend a month or so bay-whaling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
in some quiet inlet unknown to, and uncared
for by, the bustling merchantman.</p>

<p>In these secluded spots the California devil-fish,
mussel-digger, grey-back, and several other aliases
not fit for publication, but all showing how the
object of them is esteemed by his neighbours, may
sometimes be taken at a disadvantage, the cows
languid just before or after parturition, and the
bulls who escort them too intent upon their loves
to be as wily as is their wont.</p>

<p>But only the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of the Yankee whalemen,
dexterous and daring as are all the tribe, can hope
to get “to windward,” of the diabolically cunning
giants whom they abuse with such fluent and
frequent flow of picturesque profanity. It is a
peculiar characteristic of this animal that it seems
ever on the alert, scarcely exposing for one moment
its broad back above the sea-surface when rising to
spout, and generally travelling, unlike all its
congeners, not upon, but a few feet below, the
water. For this reason, and in this fishery alone,
the whalers arm themselves with iron-shafted
harpoons, in order to strike with greater force and
certainty of direction a whale some distance beneath
the surface. A standing order, too, among them
is never by any chance to injure a calf while the
mother lives, since such an act exposes all and
sundry near the spot to imminent and violent
death.</p>

<p>Neglect of this most necessary precaution, or
more probably accident, once brought about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
calamity that befell a fleet of thirteen American
whaleships which had been engaged in the “bowhead”
fishery among the ice-floes of the Arctic
Pacific. In order to waste no time, they came
south when winter set in, and by common consent
rendezvoused in Margharita Bay, Lower California,
for a month or two’s “devil-fishing.”</p>

<p>The whales were exceedingly abundant that
season, and all the ships were soon busy with as
much blubber as they could manage. The ease
with which the whales were being obtained,
however, led to considerable carelessness and
forgetfulness of the fact that the whale never
changes its habits. One bright morning, about
three weeks after the opening of the season, the
whole flotilla of fifty-two boats, four from each
ship, had been lowered and were making their way
as rapidly as possible to the outlying parts of the
great bay, keeping a bright look-out for “fish.”
Spreading out fan-wise, they were getting more
and more scattered, when about the centre of the
fleet some one suddenly “struck” and got fast
to a fish. But hardly had the intimation been
given when something very like panic seized upon
the crowd. In a moment or two the reason was
apparent. From some cause, never definitely
known, a harpooner had in striking at a large cow
whale transfixed her calf at her side with his
harpoon, killing it immediately. The mother,
having quietly satisfied herself that her offspring
was really dead, turned upon her aggressors like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
veritable demon of destruction, and, while carefully
avoiding exposure of her body to attack, simply
spread devastation among the flotilla. Whenever
she rose to the surface, it was but for a second, to
emit an expiration like the hiss of a lifting safety-valve,
and almost always to destroy a boat or
complete the destruction of one already hopelessly
damaged.</p>

<p>Every blow was dealt with an accuracy and
appearance of premeditation that filled the superstitious
Portuguese, who formed a good half of the
crews, with dismay—the more so that many of
them could only guess at the original cause of what
was really going on. The speed of the monster
was so great, that her almost simultaneous appearance
at points widely separated made her seem
ubiquitous; and as she gave no chance whatever
for a blow, it certainly looked as if all the boats
would be destroyed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">seriatim</i>. Not content with
dealing one tremendous blow at a boat and reducing
it at once to a bundle of loose boards, she renewed
her attentions again and again to the wreckage,
as if determined that the destruction should
be complete.</p>

<p>Utter demoralisation had seized even the
veterans, and escape was the only thought governing
all action. But the distance to shore was great,
and the persistence and vigour of the furious
leviathan, so far from diminishing, seemed to
increase as the terrible work went on. At last two
boats did succeed in reaching the beach at a point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
where it sloped very gradually. The crews had
hardly leaped overboard, to run their craft up
high and dry, when close behind them in the
shallows foamed and rolled their relentless enemy,
just too late to reach them. Out of the large
number of well-equipped boats that left the ships
that morning, only these two escaped undamaged,
and the loss of the season’s work was irremediable.
Over fifty men were badly injured, and six, one of
whom was the unhappy origin of the whole trouble,
were killed outright. The triumphant avenger of
her slain offspring disappeared as silently as she
had carried on her deadly warfare, as far as could
be known unhurt, and with an accumulated hoard
of experience that would, if possible, render her
more of a “devil” to any unsuspecting whalemen
who should hereafter have the misfortune to meet
with and attack her than she had proved herself to
be already.</p>

<p>Dejected and crippled, the fleet lost no time in
getting away from the spot and fleeing north to
San Francisco, there to refit for other and more
profitable fishing grounds.</p>

<p>There are a great many “ower-true” tales told
of the prowess of this wily creature, but the
selection that I have made will doubtless suffice
for a fair specimen of what the California “devil-fish”
is capable of when opportunity arises.</p>

<p>The volatile and tuneful negroes of the West
India islands have their own peculiar “devil-fish,”
but in this case there is nothing diabolical in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
appearance or vast in the size of the creature. It
is, indeed, a very well-known fish in most tropical
waters, and must from its habits and appearance
be closely allied to the hake and pike. Among
seamen generally it is well known as the barracouta,
and is especially plentiful around the New Zealand
coast, where a few hours of the peculiar fishing
practised by the Maories will generally reward the
fisherman with a gross or so of fish averaging 10
to 12 lb. each.</p>

<p>It is among the Leeward Islands, however, that
the barracouta attains his largest dimensions, and
has inspired the fishermen and boatmen with such
dread of him that, while they hold the universally
feared shark in supreme contempt, the mere
rumour of a “devil-fish” anywhere in their vicinity
will bring every nigger within hail scrambling out
of the water in double-quick time.</p>

<p>Whether rightly or wrongly, I have never been
able to ascertain by personal observation, but undoubtedly
the fact is that the barracouta is credited
with an infernal propensity for inflicting a nameless
mutilation upon any human being unfortunate
enough to get within reach of him. He is long
and narrow, blue-black above, with a silvery-grey
belly, and swift as an arrow. His lower jaw is
considerably longer than the upper, and both are
armed with teeth, almost exactly like those of a
dog. From this configuration of the jaws it is
unnecessary for the barracouta to turn on its back,
like the shark, when he comes for you. Silent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
straight, swift, and almost invisible in those dark-blue
waters, the first intimation of his presence is
often the fatal snap of those lethal jaws, which
leaves the hapless victim beyond hope of recovery.</p>

<p>Before quitting this portion of the subject a
passing reference may be permitted to a very
disheartening occurrence due to the predatory
habits of these fish. At great cost some public-spirited
individuals had stocked the upper reaches
of the pretty river Clutha in Otago, New Zealand,
with salmon-fry from ova imported from
England. The incipient salmon flourished until
in the course of natural development they reached
the “parr” stage of their career. Then in an evil
hour they journeyed seawards until they reached
the estuary of the river. A school of barracouta
had just previously crossed the bar from the sea,
and in their search for living food happened upon
the toothsome innocents from the secure spawning-beds
above. Long did the patient watchers up-country
wait, but never more did one of those
youthful salmon return to them. All the money
spent was wasted, and all the high hopes of a
plentiful supply of indigenous salmon were frustrated
for years.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many other marine
monstrosities to which with more or less show of
reason the satanic epithet has been applied; but
they are very little known or noticed, except
within certain narrow limits. Probably enough
has been said to justify simple savages and almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
equally simple-minded seamen in bestowing upon
the creatures of their dread a name which to them
embodies all they are able to conceive of pitiless
cruelty, unquenchable ferocity, and unmatchable
cunning.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">By</span> popular consent the rash act of the daring
man who first devoured an oyster has been greatly
extolled, but what meed of praise should be
awarded to that dim and distant discoverer who
first essayed to break into and devour the flesh of
the armour-clad tortoise or turtle? All unarmed
as he doubtless must have been, except for spear of
chipped flint or charred stick, the mere entry within

<p>But, once having tasted such good meat, how
rapidly the news must have been spread by our
friend! Here was a banquet indeed, ready to

Speed, courage, endurance, cunning, all could be

terrestrial or marine, wherever edible members
of it could be obtained; but when and why the
consumption of turtle-soup became with us a
synonym for the highest luxury in the way of
food, and indissolubly associated with the royal
hospitality of the Lord Mayor, is indeed a question
to be answered. One may be permitted to
suppose that, during the reign of some more than
usually gifted <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cordon bleu</i>, the grand discovery
was made that the peculiar flesh of this succulent
reptile lent itself most amicably and gelatinously
to the wonderful disguise with which it is invested
ere it becomes the dream of the epicure. The
pages of ancient Latin writers abound with descriptions,
not only of strange foods, but stranger
modes of preparing them for the table, the mere
recital of which to-day is often sufficient to
effectually banish appetite. Among these early
recipes are many for dealing with the flesh of both
land and sea tortoises. According to their light
those ancient cooks excelled in curious ways of
dressing turtle, or rather disguising it, for it must
be confessed that turtle-steak <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au naturel</i> is not
of that exquisite flavour to appeal to the palate
like a plain beefsteak or mutton-chop. Good,
wholesome, and tender as it undoubtedly is, it
tastes more like veal with a nuance of fish than
anything else in the best kinds; while many turtles,
from feeding upon cuttle-fish, have a decidedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
unpleasant, musky flavour. Few flesh foods pall
quicker upon the palate. In most West Indian
coast towns an abundant meal of turtle can be obtained
for the equivalent of sixpence whenever
required, but except by those whose object is to
fill up cheaply and quickly, it is little appreciated.</p>

<p>I was once mate of a barque gathering a cargo
of mahogany along the Mexican coast, and while
lying at Tonala the supply of fresh beef ran short.
The skipper bought a fine large turtle for a mere
trifle from some fishermen, and rather chuckled at
the prospect of getting two days’ meat for less than
the usual price of one. He gave orders to the
worn-out seaman whom, in common with vessels
of that class, we carried as cook, etc., to apportion
the joints. At eight bells a procession of weary-looking
men slouched aft, the foremost one bearing
a kid of something. He came to the break of the
poop, and as spokesman inquired for the captain.
That gentleman stepped briskly forward, saying,
“Well, what’s up now?” “What d’ye call <em>that</em>,
sir?” said the man. “<em>That</em>,” said the skipper,
giving just a glance at the queer-looking mess
in the kid; “why yer so-and-so idiot, that’s what
the Lord Mayor gives about a guinea a hounce
for. Why, only the haristocracy gets a charnce
at ’ome to eat the likes o’ that.” “Oh, very well,”
said the man; “p’r’aps you’ll eat it yourself then,
sir, since its <em>so</em> —— good, and give us what we
signed for. We aint crockeydiles to eat shell-fish,
shells an’ all.” With that he planted his little tub,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
with its strange contents, down on the poop and
stalked forward again, followed by his scowling
shipmates. I am bound to admit that there was
little room for wonder that Jack on this occasion
preferred <em>salt horse</em> to boiled turtle.</p>

<p>But this is by the way. Of terrestrial Chelones
there is an immense variety distributed over almost
the whole land surface of the globe where the
mean annual temperature does not fall below 60°.
The flesh of these reptiles is, with few exceptions,
notably that of the American Terrapin, very lightly
esteemed by civilised peoples, and in some species
highly poisonous. A very strange fact concerning
land tortoises is the presence of the largest members
of the family upon such widely separated and inhospitable
spots as Aldabra and Agalegas Islands
in the Indian Ocean, and the Galapagos group in
the South Pacific. In these lonely islets—for
they are hardly more—enormous specimens of
these strange reptiles crawl sluggishly about,
grazing upon the scanty herbage, secure from all
enemies except man, and apparently gifted with
incredible longevity. As far as natural decay is
concerned, they would certainly appear to be
unaffected by the flight of time, although one
need not believe unless he wants to the story of
the sailor of one upon whose shell he saw carved
the legend, ‘The Ark—Captain Noah; Ararat,
for orders.’ The Galapagans eat them during
scarcity of other food, but do not hanker after
them as regular diet. They do, however, prize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the fat oil which some of these reptiles possess in
great abundance, and whenever they catch one
and do not need its flesh, they cut a slit in the
leathery skin between the upper and lower shells
near the tail and take a peep within. If the
victim be not fat enough for their purpose they
release him, and he shuffles off apparently quite
unaffected by this rough surgery. Indeed, such is
the incredible vitality of these reptiles that they
have been known to live for six months after
having their brains entirely removed, and one
existed for twenty-three days after its head had
been cut off.</p>

<p>Redi, the well-known Italian surgeon, who
made these apparently useless experiments, states
that, upon opening the body of the last-mentioned
tortoise, on the twenty-third day he saw the triple
heart beating, and the blood entering and leaving
it. What he hoped to establish by such cruel
doings is not stated by him.</p>

<p>Varieties of land tortoises are exceedingly numerous,
and embrace some very peculiar forms,
notably the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Emysaura serpentina</i>, which is a kind
of compromise between a lizard and a tortoise,
lives in and around Oriental lakes and rivers, and
feeds indiscriminately upon small fish, reptiles,
and birds. The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chelodina Novæ Hollandiæ</i> of
Australia, with its long snake-like neck and wide
gaping jaws; the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chelys matamata</i>, loving stagnant
pools, and adorned about the head and neck with
sprouting fringes like bunches of rootlets, giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
it a most uncanny appearance; and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gymnopus</i>
of African rivers, which feeds upon young crocodiles,
and whose flesh is nevertheless most delicate
and highly prized, and many others, furnish a
most interesting study, but not strictly germane to
our subject, which is turtle—the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Thalassians</i> or
oceanic tortoises, from which alone our supplies
are drawn.</p>

<p>Among marine tortoises or turtles there is
vastly less variety than among their congeners of
the land. Sir Richard Owen decided that only
five well-defined species are known to exist at the
present day, although the fossil remains of true
turtles show that a much greater range of these
varieties existed in prehistoric times. The principal
difference between tortoise and turtle is the shape
of the paws, which in the land varieties are always
armed with claws, and have a strong likeness to
the legs of a lizard. In the turtles these clawed
feet become flippers, almost fins, wonderfully
adapted for swimming purposes, but rendering the
turtle when on land more helpless and clumsy in
his locomotion than even a seal.</p>

<p>Turtles are true amphibians, although, owing to
the extent and volume of their arbitrary lungs,
and perhaps also to their general sluggishness of
habit, they can and do remain under water for a
longer time than any other amphibian, with the
exception, perhaps, of the crocodile. But, like the
saurian just mentioned, it is imperative that they
leave the sea periodically for the purpose of laying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
their eggs, which they do in loose sand, leaving
them to be hatched by the heat of the sun. It
has been authoritatively stated that when the
young turtle first emerges from the egg his shell is
not formed, and that he is white in colour.
Perhaps different species may account for a discrepancy
here; but I can only say, that having,
for many hours, along the shores of islets in the
Caribbean Sea and around the Gulf of Mexico,
amused myself by digging up turtles’ and crocodiles’
eggs, breaking them, and sending the lively
occupants afloat, I have never seen either a white
or a shell-less one. Of course the shell was not of
the substance one would expect in a full-grown
individual, but it was hard and perfectly formed,
while the tiny creature was wonderfully swift in
its movements. Innumerable enemies await the
infant turtle, extending even to his own kind,
and but a small percentage of those hatched are
privileged to arrive at maturity. Nevertheless,
such is the fecundity of these reptiles, that their
numbers are exceedingly large, and even where
old-established stations for turtle-catching exist,
no diminution of their numbers is ever seen.</p>

<p>Having reached a weight of about twenty-five
pounds, they are thenceforth safe from all enemies
except man, and even he gets but scant opportunity
to molest them save when they visit their
favourite beaches for family purposes.</p>

<p>When a lad of thirteen I had the misfortune to
be cast away upon one of the reef-fringed islets in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the Bay of Campêche. The vessel became a total
wreck, and we escaped to the islet, finding it bare
of everything but an immense number of boobies
and frigate-birds, the beach being covered with the
eggs of the former, and the rocks plentifully
besprinkled with the eggs of the latter. The first
night of our stay I was taking a lonely stroll along
the beach—the whole circuit of the isle could be
made under an hour—when I saw a light cloud of
sand rising from the smooth white plain just ahead
of me. At first the idea of an inrush of the sea
occurred to me; but going carefully nearer, I
saw an immense black centre to the misty spot,
apparently digging furiously. Hurrying back to
camp, I gave the alarm, and three of the men
accompanied me back. Without any difficulty
they managed to secure the creature, which was an
enormous turtle weighing not less than 1800 lb.
It was rather a tough job turning her over, but
once on her broad back she was helpless, and was
speedily towed to camp. Next morning at daybreak
she was butchered, and more than eight
hundred eggs, of which only thirteen were with
shells, were taken from her ovary. The carapace
was so large that it made me a good bath. The
meat was all removed and hung up, only the head
and tail being left attached to the shell. Late that
afternoon a young Dane, in some foolish freak or
another, must needs go and introduce two of his
fingers into the open mouth of the apparently
dead head. Like the action of an iron-shearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
press the jaws closed, taking off the two fingers as
clean as possible. Then another man essayed to
cut off the tail, but as soon as the knife entered
the skin the tail curled up and gripped the blade,
and it was nearly an hour before he could withdraw
it. So that their vitality must be little, if
any, inferior to that of the land tortoise.</p>

<p>One of the most favoured spots frequented by
turtle is, or used to be, the desolate island of
Ascension in the South Atlantic, a barren volcanic
patch belonging to Britain, and, because used
exclusively as a naval depot, entered upon the
books of the Admiralty as one of Her Majesty’s
ships. An enormous number of turtle were annually
“turned” there, and preserved in a small
lagoon from shipment to shipment. It was my
pleasant privilege to assist at one of these turnings,
and I bear a very vivid recollection of the game.
Crouched low behind an immense boulder one evening
about eight o’clock, we could hear a hollow
reverberating murmur of the mighty surf outside,
suggesting sleepily irresistible force. A dazzling
wreath of snowy foam, gleaming like burnished
silver, fringed the quiet stretch of glittering sand,
which, gently sloping upward and landward, was
bounded by gloomy bastions of black lava.
Beyond that shining semicircle of glowing white
lay the sombre blue-black bosom of the quiet
little bay, now heaving gently as that of a sleeping
child. Hither and thither, threading its mysterious
depths, glided spectrally broad tracks of greenish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
light, vivid, yet ever brightening and fading, as if
of living flame. Presently there emerged from
the retreating smother of spume a creeping something
of no very definite shape, under the glamour
of the molten moonlight, but making an odd
shuffling progress inland, and becoming more recognisable
as it rose. Another, and yet another,
and still more arrived as the shining tracks converged
shorewards. At last the dark shapes came
near enough for a novice to know them for turtle.
Soon the first-comers reached their limit, and
began the work for which they were here. Each
massive reptile, by an indescribable motion of its
fore-flippers, delved into the yielding grit, throwing
the spoil behind it and upward withal until
it was enveloped in a misty halo of shining sand.
Then the whole beach was alive with the toiling
Chelones and their male attendants, who shuffled
about, emitting curious noises, but whether of
encouragement or affection this deponent sayeth
not.</p>

<p>Divers of them came from far—so far that
none who have not witnessed the swift cleaving of
their true element by these ungainly monsters
could believe how the wide sweep of those eager
flippers devours the fleeting leagues. In a short
time many of the delving turtles had sunk below
the level of the surrounding sand, while some had
ceased their digging and commenced to deposit
their eggs. Suddenly we rushed upon them, and
for some minutes the swarming beach was apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
a scene of wild confusion. Really, the plan
of attack was well ordered; and when the first
scurry was over nearly all the visitors were to be
seen wrong side up, waving their flippers deprecatingly.
In less than half an hour the loneliness was
again regnant, the victims having been towed off
through a gap in the rocks to a spacious spoilarium
in the lagoon behind, there to await their transit
to the goal of most good things, London town.</p>

<p>While the capture of turtle upon a sandy shore
necessarily admits of but few variations, the pursuit
of these reptiles in their proper element lends
itself to many peculiarities. How often does the
ever-hungry sailor, striving wearily to forget his
plentiful lack of tasty eatables while on the look-out
of some calm-bound “wind-jammer,” get a
delightful thrill upon seeing the broad shining
back of a sleeping <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Spharga</i> calmly floating upon
the sunlit surface of the silent sea! Visions of “a
fresh mess for all hands” nerve the watch to
desperate efforts in order to quickly free the gig
from its long-disused trammels. Once afloat,
there are several ways of securing the prize.
Roughly, the orthodox method is for one hand to
“scull” the boat with one oar over the stern <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la
Chinoise</i>, while one stationed in the bow may,
when near enough, drive a harpoon through the
carapace of the slumberer. Or one may not.
And candour compels the statement that the
percentage of successes is not high. If the performer
be not very expert with the weapon—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
very few sailors are—the result is usually a burst
of angry jeers from disappointed shipmates, and a
few eddying swirls on the surface whence the
awakened turtle has fled in amazement.</p>

<p>Another way practised most successfully by the
amphibious Kanakas of Polynesia is to slip noiselessly
into the water, and, diving beneath the
turtle, grasp the hind flippers with crossed hands.
One swift and dexterous twist places the prize on
his back, in which helpless position he is kept
with ease upon the surface until the canoe arrives
and he is transferred to it. Among the coral
reefs of the Friendly Islands turtle-fishing is a
highly favoured form of sport, and when the
reptiles are surprised among the tortuous shallow
channels between the reefs or in the almost land-locked
lagoons, they rarely escape. Here it is
usual for the fisherman to spring upon the turtle’s
back, and, clutching the fore edge of the shell
with both hands, to hang on until his prize is
exhausted and speedily brought to the surface.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>But of all the fashions of securing this much-hunted
creature, that followed by the ingenious
fisher-folk of the Chinese littoral bears away the
palm. Most voyagers in tropical seas are acquainted
with a peculiar fish, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">E. remora</i>, known
generally by the trivial name of “sucker.” The
distinguishing characteristic of this fish is laziness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
Unwilling to exert itself overmuch in the
pursuit of food, it has developed an arrangement
on the back of its head exactly like the corrugated
sole of a tennis shoe, and as artificial in
appearance as if made and fitted by the hand of
man. When the sucker finds itself in the vicinity
of any large floating body, such as a ship, a shark,
or a piece of flotsam, whose neighbourhood seems
to promise an abundance of food, it attaches
itself firmly thereto by means of this curious contrivance,
which permits it to eat, breathe, and
perform all necessary functions while being carried
about without any exertion on its part. It can
attach and detach itself instantaneously, and holds
so firmly that a direct backward pull cannot dislodge
it without injury to the fish. The Chinese,
who have successfully trained the cormorant and
the otter to fish for them, have taken the remora
in hand with the happiest results. Several good-sized
specimens having been caught, small iron rings
are fitted to their tails, to which are attached long,
slender, but very strong lines. Thus equipped, the
fishermen set out, and when a basking turtle is
seen, two or three of the suckers are slipped overboard.
Should they turn and stick to the bottom
of the sampan, they are carefully detached by
being pushed forward with the inevitable bamboo,
and started on the search again. At last they
attach themselves to the supine turtle. Then
the fishermen haul in the lines, against which
gentle suasion the hapless Chelone struggles in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
vain. Once on board the lugger, the useful
remora is detached, and is at once ready for use
again.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> But the turtle can by no means be kept on the surface
until it <em>is</em> exhausted. The first act of a hunted turtle is to
seek the depths.</p>

</div>

<p>The same mode of catching turtle is followed
by the fishermen of the East African coast, from
Mozambique northward. The coast of Africa has
long been famous for its turtle, and Pliny tells
of the Chelonophagi of the Red Sea, a race of
turtle-eaters, who were able to obtain these creatures
of so gigantic a size that they could utilise
the carapaces for roofs to their dwellings and
boats for their feeble voyages. Strabo also alludes
to these people; but without accusing either of
these venerable authorities of exaggeration, it is
pretty certain that no such enormous specimens
of Chelonia are ever met with in these days.</p>

<p>Tortoise-shell is well known to be furnished by
the turtle, the best by the Hawk’s Bill variety,
which supplies the worst flesh, being exceedingly
musky (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chelone imbricata</i>). The green turtle
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chelonée franche</i>) is most valuable for food,
and attains, with another well-marked variety
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Spharga Coriacea</i>), the largest size of all turtles
known. This latter has been sometimes taken on
the coast of Britain, several of large size (700 to
800 lb. weight) having been recorded as caught
in our seas.</p>

<span class="subhead">‘HOVELLING’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor smaller">2</a></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">What</span> particular law of etymology has been
evoked to produce the queer word standing at the
head of this paper I am unable to imagine. Like
Topsy, I “’spects it growed,” but my own private
opinion is that it is the Kentish coast way of pronouncing
the word “hovering,” since the hovellers
are certainly more often occupied in hovering than
in doing anything more satisfactory to themselves.</p>

<p>However strange the word may sound in a
landsman’s ears, it is one of the most familiar to
British seamen, especially among our coasters,
although the particular form of bread-winning
that it is used to designate is practically confined
to the Kent and Sussex shores of the English
Channel, having its headquarters at Deal. Briefly,
a “hoveller” is a boatman who follows none of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
the steady orthodox lines of boatmanship, such as
fishing, plying for passengers, etc., but hovers
around the Channel, a snapper-up of unconsidered
trifles, a pilot, a wrecker, or if a ghost of a chance
presents itself, a smuggler.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Whilst this reprint was in the press the writer received
an ingenious explanation of the word from Mr. Charles Fleet,
an old resident on the Sussex coast. He derives it from
“Hoviler,” a sort of mounted militia raised during the
Commonwealth, and so named from the “hovils” (leathern
jackets) they wore.</p>

</div>

<p>Naturally, the poor hoveller does not bear the
best of characters. The easy unconventional fit
of his calling settles that for him as conclusively
as the cryptic term “general dealer,” so often seen
in police-court reports, does a man’s status ashore,
but with far less reason. It must be admitted
that he is not over-scrupulous or prone to regard
too rigidly the laws of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">meum</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tuum</i>. The
portable property which occasionally finds its way
into his boat is, however, usually ownerless except
for the lien held by the Crown upon all flotsam,
jetsam, and ligan; which rights, all unjust as he
in common with most seafarers consider them to
be, he can hardly be blamed for ignoring.</p>

<p>But when the worst that can be alleged against
the character of the hoveller has been said, a very
large margin of good remains to his credit, good
of which the general public never hears, or hearing
of it, bestows the praise elsewhere.</p>

<p>They are the finest boatmen in the world.
Doubtless this seems a large claim to make on
their behalf, but it is one that will be heartily
endorsed by all who know anything of the condition
of the English Channel in winter, and are
at the same time in a position to make comparisons.
And it must also be remembered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the harvest of the hoveller is gathered when the
wintry weather is at its worst, when the long,
hungry snare of the Goodwins is snarling and
howling for more and more of man’s handiwork
to fill its for ever unsatisfied maw, when the whole
width of the strait is like a seething cauldron, and
the atmosphere is one weltering whirl of hissing
spindrift; while the hooting syrens, shrieking
whistles, and clanging bells from the benighted
and groping crowd of unseen vessels blend their
discord with the tigerish roar of the storm in one
bewildering chaos of indescribable tumult.</p>

<p>Then, when the fishermen have all run for
shelter, and even the hardy tugboats hug some
sheltering spit or seaward-stretching point, the
hoveller in his undecked clinker-built lugger, some
thirty-five feet long and ten feet beam, square-sterned
and sturdy-looking like himself, may be
seen through the writhing drifts of fog and spray
climbing from steep to steep of the foaming billows
like a bat hawking along some jagged cliff.</p>

<p>She shows just a tiny patch of brown sail, a
mere shred, but sufficient to keep her manageable
with her head within five or six points of the
wind and her stub-bow steadily pointed to the
onrush of the toppling seas. Every other wave
sends a solid sheet of spray right over her, hiding
her momentarily from view, but the row of squat
figures sitting motionless along the weather gunwale
heed it no more than as if they were graven images.
And thus they cruise, hungry and thirsty, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
eyeballs burning with sleeplessness, throughout the
weary hours of night and day, with every sense
acutely strained and every moment balanced upon
the very scythe-edge of death. Long practice
makes them keen of sight as the wailing gulls
overhead, and small indeed must be the floating
object that escapes their unremitting scrutiny.</p>

<p>Homeward-bound sailing ships from oversea
ports are what they principally lust after. The
skippers of these vessels after their long absence
from home usually feel more or less anxious as
they near the narrows. The Trinity pilots in
their trim cutters have their cruising ground
definitely fixed for them by authority, extending
no further west than Dungeness. But long before
that well-known point, with its dazzling spear of
electric radiance reflected from the gloomy pall
of cloud above, is reached, the homeward-bound
skipper’s anxiety becomes almost unbearable if the
weather be thick and he has as yet made no landfall
to verify his position. Then the sudden
appearance of a hoveller emerging from the mirk
around, and his cheery hail, “D’ye want a pilot,
sir?” is heavenly in its relief. For these men,
although regarded with no small contempt and
disfavour by the aristocracy of pilotage licensed by
the Trinity Brethren, know the Channel as a man
knows the house he has lived in for years, know it
at all times, whether in calm or storm, the blackness
of winter midnight, the brilliance of summer noon,
or the horrible uncertainty of enshrouding fog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>The hoveller can hardly be blamed if he take
full advantage of the foulness of the weather to
drive as hard a bargain as he can with the skipper
of a hesitating homeward-bounder for the hire of
his invaluable local knowledge. Full well he
knows that when the skies are serene and the wind
is favourable he may tender his services in vain,
even at the lowest price. No master, in these
days of fierce competition, dare make an entry of
a hoveller’s fee in his bill of expenses, except under
pressure of bad weather, on pain of being considered
unfit for his post, and finding himself
compelled to pay the charge out of his own scanty
salary.</p>

<p>So that fine weather to the hoveller spells empty
pocket and hungry belly. The long, bright days
of summer bring to him no joy, though thoughtless
passengers lounging at their ease upon the
promenade deck of some palatial steamship may
think his lot a lazy, lotus-eating way of drowsing
through the sunny hours. Neither would they
imagine from his wooden immobility of pose and
the unbending appearance of his rig what fiery
energy he is capable of displaying when opportunity
arises.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when I was a lad of eighteen,
we were homeward bound from Luzon to London.
We sighted Corvo dimly through the driving
mist of a fierce westerly gale, before which we
bowled along at the rate of 300 miles a day. For
nearly five days we fled thus for home, seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
nothing except an occasional dim shape of some
vessel flitting silently past. Not a glimpse of the
heavenly bodies was vouchsafed us whereby to fix
our position, nor did we haul up once for a cast of
the deep-sea lead. At last by “dead reckoning,”
we were well up Channel, but the steady thrust of
the gale never wavered in force or direction. The
mist grew denser, the darkness more profound.
By the various sounds of foghorns and whistles
we knew that many vessels surrounded us, and that
it was scarcely less dangerous to heave-to than to
run. Presently, by the narrowest of shaves, we
missed running down a light outward-bound
barque, the incident leaving us with yards swinging
every way and a general feeling of uncertainty as
to what would happen next. Suddenly out of the
gloom to leeward came the hoarse cry, “Want a
pilot, sir?” It was the sweetest music imaginable.
All eyes were strained in the direction of the voice.
In a minute or two the well-known shape of a
hovelling lugger became visible, under a double
reefed lug, rushing towards us. He rounded to
by our lee quarter, and in reply to our skipper’s
query, “How much will you take me up to the
Ness for?” came the prompt answer; “Ten pounds.”
“Ten devils!” yelled our skipper; “why, you adjective
hovelling pirate, it’s only about ten minutes’
walk.” “Better get out ’n walk it then, cap’n,”
said the boatman; “can’t take you up for no less
to-night.” The usual haggling began, but was
cut short by the hoveller, who shouted, “So long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
cap’n, time’s precious,” giving at the same time a
pull at his tiller which sent the boat striding a
cable’s length to leeward. “All right,” roared the
old man, “come aboard, and be dam’d t’you,”
and at the word the lugger was back alongside
again. Launching his dinghy was out of the
question in such a sea, for at one moment the
boat was level with our shearpoles, the next she
seemed groping under our keel. “Heave us a
line, cap’n,” shouted he, and the mate hurled a
coil of the lee main-brace at him. Quick as a wink
he had cast a bowline round his waist with the
end. “Haul away aboard,” he cried, and as his
boat rose on the crest of a big sea he sprang at the
ship and missed her. But he had hardly time to
disappear in the smother of foam, before he was
being dragged up the side like a bale of rags, and
almost instantly tumbled on deck. Springing to
his feet, he dashed the water out of his eyes, and
as calmly as if nothing unusual had happened, said
to the man at the wheel, “Put your hellum up,
m’lad, square away the main-yard, haul aft the mainsheet,”
and as if by magic the weather seemed to
fine down and a great peace reigned. “Steady as
she goes, m’lad,” said he to the helmsman, with a
peep at the compass; and then turning to the
skipper, in a wheedling voice, “You couldn’t
spare my mates a bit o’ grub, I s’pose, sir, and a
plug of terbacker?” “Oh yes,” replied the
captain with alacrity. “Stooard! get a couple o’
pieces of beef out o’ the harness cask, and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
bread in a bag, for the boatmen. I’ll go down
and get them some tobacco.” Already the lugger
was closing in on us again, and by the time the
longed-for provisions were at hand, she was
near enough for them to be hove on board. A
further plea for a drop of rum could not be
entertained, as we had none, but well pleased with
the result of their visit the rovers sheered off and
were swallowed up in the encircling darkness.
Exactly three-quarters of an hour later we rounded
the Ness and hove-to for the pilot, the lugger
popping up under our lee again as if she had been
towing astern, and receiving back the lucky
hoveller with his fat fee in his pocket.</p>

<p>Years after, in a much larger ship, of which I
was second mate, we were bound right round the
coast to Dundee, and got befogged somewhere off
Beachy Head. As on the previous occasion, the
wind was strong, and blowing right up Channel.
A hoveller came alongside and made a bargain to
take us up to Dungeness for ten pounds. By the
time he had scrambled on board, our captain began
to wonder whether he might be available to pilot
us right round to Dundee, not feeling very confident
in his own knowledge of the navigation of
the East coast. So he put the question to our
visitor, who replied that he himself was not qualified,
and indeed would not be allowed to take us
if he were. But he could arrange to have a North
Sea pilot out in Deal Roads awaiting us on our
arrival there. This was too much for our skipper’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
power of belief. That cockle-shell of a lugger able
to outstrip his 1400-ton ship, with this breeze
behind her, so much in forty miles! It couldn’t
be done. “Never mind, sir,” said the hoveller,
“you make my money thirteen pound for the whole
job, and if you have to wait in the Downs for your
pilot, you needn’t pay me more than ten.” “It’s
a go,” answered the captain, fully satisfied.</p>

<p>Hailing his boat, the Dealman gave his instructions.
Crowding on all sail, away she went,
sheering in for the shore, and soon was lost to
sight in the mist. Meanwhile we also set all the
sail she could carry, and made a fairly rapid run to
the Downs. Sure enough, there was a galley punt
awaiting us, the men lying on their oars, and the
pilot with his bag lounging in the stern. The
skipper said not a word as he handed our hoveller
his full money, but he looked like a man who had
been badly beaten in a contest of wits.</p>

<p>But if one would see the hoveller at his best, it
is when some hapless vessel has met her fate on
the Goodwins during a gale. The silent suck of
those never-resting sands makes the time of her
remaining above water very short, without the
certainty of her rapid breaking up under the terrible
battering of the mighty seas. Gathering
around the doomed fabric, like jackals round a
carcass, the hardy beachmen perform prodigies of
labour. The work which they will do, wrenching
out cargo and fittings, and transferring them to
their boats, while the straining, groaning hull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
threatens every moment to collapse beneath their
eager feet, and the bitter tempest fills the air with
salt spray, to say nothing of an occasional breaker
which buries wreck and wreckers alike beneath its
incalculable mass of foaming water, cannot be
adequately described—it must be seen to be realised.
As if mad with desire, they tear and strain and
heave like Titans, apparently insensible to fatigue.
For they know that at any moment their prize
may vanish from beneath them, and with her all
their hopes of gain. Weather has for them no
terrors. Let but the cry of “wreck” go up, and
though even the lifeboat be beaten back, the
hoveller will get there somehow, not under any
pretence of philanthropy, but in the hope of earning
something, though it may be gratefully recorded
that they never shirk the most terrible risks when
there is a hope of saving life.</p>

<p>Such sudden and violent transitions from utter
idleness to the most tremendous exertion as they
continually experience do not seem to harm these
toughened amphibia. Plenty of them do of
course “go under,” in more or less distressing
circumstances, but though their own tiny circle
laments their loss, their tragic fate makes no more
disturbance than the drop of a pebble outside of
it. There are plenty to take their place. For
even in so precarious a calling as hovelling there
are grades. The poor possessors of only a four-oared
galley hope to rise to the dignity of a lugger,
so that they may quit scrabbling along the shores<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
and get out to where, if the dangers are indefinitely
increased, the chances of a good haul now and
then are proportionately greater.</p>

<p>Another phase of their calling is the rescue of
vessels who from various causes are drifting to
destruction. Many a craft reaches port in safety
with a couple of Dealmen on board, that but for
their timely help would never have been heard of
again. I know of one case where a large French
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chasse-marée</i>, with a cargo of wine, lost her foremast
off the Varne shoal. In its fall it crippled
the skipper and one of the crew. Another one
was frost-bitten, and the remaining two, both boys,
were so paralysed with fright that they were quite
useless. So in the grey of the New Year’s dawn,
with a pitiless snowstorm raging from the N.W.,
she was drifting helplessly along the edge of the
sand. Two hovellers saw her plight at the same
time, and each strained every nerve to get up to
her first, for she was a prize well worth the
winning. At last they drew so near to her that
it was anybody’s race. But the head man of the
foremost lugger tore off his oilskins, sea-boots,
and fear-nought jacket, and plunging into the
boiling sea actually battled his way to her side,
climbing on board triumphantly, and so making
good his claim. It is satisfactory to be able to
add that the dauntless rascal was completely
successful in bringing the <i>Trois Frères</i> into
Dover, and shared with his four mates £120 for
salvage services. Not a bad twenty-four hours’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
work, but for nearly two months before they had
earned less than five shillings per man per week,
and they all had wives and families dependent
upon them.</p>

<p>Yet with all their hardships, they are free. No
man is their master, for they always sail on shares,
varied a little according to each individual’s
monetary stake in the boat. And doubtless the
wild life has a certain charm of its own, which
goes far to counterbalance its severity and danger.
“An’ anyhow,” as one of them said to me not
long ago, “ourn’s a bizness the bloomin’ Germans
ain’t likely to do us out of. There ain’t many
left like that, is ther?”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LOSS OF THE ‘ST. GEORGE’</span>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">An Incident of the Anglo-German
War of 19—</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">“Things</span> is lookin’ pretty bad for the British
sailor, Bill, don’t ye think?”</p>

<p>“Well, fur’s I c’n see, they can’t look much
wuss, Joe. I know one thing: ’f I c’d a only
got a billet ashore—even a bloomin’ dus’man’s
job—I’d a never even smelt salt water agen. W’y,
there ain’t no Henglish ships now ’ceptin’ fur the
flag. But I will say this much; I never seen it
quite so bad’s this afore.”</p>

<p>The speakers were the only two British seamen
before the mast on board the four-masted steel
sailing ship <i>St. George</i>, of Liverpool, bound from
London to Melbourne with a general cargo of
immense value, and nearly five thousand tons
measurement. In the square of the main hatch
was carefully stowed forty tons of blasting and
rifle powder received at the “red buoy,” Gravesend,
and earning a very high freight. The master was
a German of Rostock, Friedrich Schwartz by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
name, who for the wage of £10 per month was
filling this onerous position to the exclusion of an
Englishman, who thought such a post deserved
better pay. The chief officer, unfortunately for
him, was a Liverpool man, with a little money of
his own, who could therefore afford to cut rates
as well as the Germans. Every other member of
the ship’s company, except the two worthies above-mentioned
and a couple of <i>Warspite</i> lads, was a
“ja-for-yes man” as Jack impartially denominates
Scandinavians and Teutons alike.</p>

<p>When the <i>St. George</i> left the East India Docks,
the managing director (she belonged to a single-ship
company whereof none of the shareholders
knew anything of the shipping business) chuckled
to himself to think how cheaply she was manned,
and hurried back to Billiter Street to calculate his
commission on the outward passage. The political
outlook was very gloomy. Germany was growing
more insolently aggressive every day, and the
omniscient Kaiser smiled grimly as he read the
latest report of the British Registrar-General of
Seamen. He was naturally delighted to see how
completely the British nation was handing over
the control of its vast mercantile marine to foreign
officers and seamen, all of whom were trained
naval men, and capable of immediately utilising
any sudden opportunity of dealing Britain a deadly
blow.</p>

<p>At the time alluded to at the opening of this
story, the <i>St. George</i>, under a towering mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
of canvas, was bowling rapidly through the north-east
Trades towards the Line. Needless, perhaps,
to say that the Britons on board were having an
uncomfortable time of it. The mate was made
to feel at every turn that he was an interloper.
Although his country’s flag sheltered him, Captain
Schwartz’s contempt for England and all that
belonged to her was freely vented in his hearing.
And all conversation on board, as well as most
of the orders, being in German, Mr. Brown and
his four compatriots felt that they were indeed
aliens on sufferance. Like the majority of their
countrymen, they knew no language but their own,
which in the present instance was as well for their
small remainder of mental peace. The two A.B.s
had at least one advantage over the mate, they
could talk to each other, though every “workup”
job was sorted out to them, their treatment
being just the same as the two boys.</p>

<p>So the days dragged wearily on until one
morning a streak of smoke on the northern
horizon gradually resolved itself into a splendid
armoured cruiser that overhauled the <i>St. George</i>
as if she were at anchor instead of logging twelve
knots easy. With a bird-like swoop the flyer
sheered up under her quarter, showing the white
ensign at her standard. Up went the good old
“blood and guts,” of Old England at the <i>St.
George’s</i> peak in reply, and to the incisive sea-queries
from the cruiser’s bridge, Mr. Brown
shouted back the information required as to port<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
of destination, length of passage, etc. Then came
ringing across the startling message, “War is
declared between England and Germany. But
you’re all right, I hope. There is little danger to
be apprehended from German warships. Still, be
careful, and crack on all you know if you do see
a suspicious-looking craft. Good-bye,” and the
majestic vessel sheered off at top speed for the
westward.</p>

<p>“Ha, mein verdammt Englischer schweinhund,
dot ju are, hou ju feel yoost now, hein? Gott
bewahr; ju haf komm to ein ent mit yourselluf,
aind id? Ve schou ju somedings now, und tond ju
forkedd id.” Thus the triumphant skipper,
accompanying his jeers at the mate with a horrible
grimace at the brilliant flag floating proudly overhead,
and an emphatic expectoration on the white
deck. Then, excited beyond measure, he rushed
to the break of the poop and yelled a summons in
German for all hands. Aft they came, tumbling
over one another in their eagerness, and ranged
themselves before the saloon doors. On his lofty
platform above their heads the rampant skipper
raved, stamped, gesticulated, and finally burst
sonorously into song, “Deutschland, Deutschland,
über alles,” all hands, with the miserable exception
of the handful of English, joining vociferously in
his pæan of triumph.</p>

<p>Thenceforward, a further development of
scurvy treatment took place. The mate was
no longer allowed access to the chronometer, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
permitted to “take the sun,” or work up the ship’s
position. The log-book was also taken from him,
the young third mate given charge of his watch,
and he was made to take his meals alone in his
berth. Neither he nor the two English A.B.s
were allowed to come on the poop any more, so
that they were completely in the dark as to the
position of the ship within hundreds of miles, as
from never seeing the compass they could only
guess generally how she was steering. Spiritlessly
the luckless islanders wearily worried on from day
to day, the butt of all their exulting shipmates.
When the Kaiser’s birthday came round, and the
ship was put <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en fête</i>, they were bidden sarcastically
to rejoice over the change of affairs. But with
the hoisting of an immense German flag at the
peak they lost all control of themselves, bursting
into a fury of passionate tears, mingled with curses
upon their enemies. They were immediately set
upon by the whole crowd, and after a few minutes
of desperate fighting were overpowered, heavily
ironed, and flung into the forepeak on the coals,
bruised from head to heel. Many and bitter were
their regrets as they lay on their easeless couch.
Scarcely less venomous were their curses on the
fatuous folly of the rulers who had suffered such
an event as this to become possible than on their
brutal gaolers. For as Joe muttered scornfully,
“Tain’t ’sif they hain’t been told of it. It’s been
drummed into their yeers long ’nough, God
knows, ’n all they ever sed wuz, ‘Oh, yore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
ezaggeratin’. The pussentidge uv furriners in the
British mercantile marine ain’t anythin’ like so
high az you say.”</p>

<p>“’Seems ’bout’s high’s we want, anyway,” said
Bill dreamily, while the poor mate ground his
teeth but never said a word.</p>

<p>What puzzled them all greatly was the length
of time the ship seemed to be getting into cold
weather. From the time the cruiser spoke them,
when they were in about 15 degrees N., was now
more than a month, and with the winds they had
carried they should have been running their easting
down in about 40 degrees S. But they were still
in tropical weather. At last the mate broke a
long silence by saying: “I believe he’s making
for Walvisch Bay. ’Shouldn’t wonder if there’s
some German warships there or thereabouts. I
only hope he <em>is</em> trying to get there, an’ one of our
cruisers sights him. It’s about our only chance.”</p>

<p>Several days passed and still they were kept
close prisoners in the black, stifling hole, starving
on a trifle of hard tack and water, and sinking
deeper every day into a very gulf of despair. At
last, to the practised senses of the captives, it was
evident that something was afoot. She had hove
to. On deck the Deutschers were in trouble.
As the mate had surmised, they were bound for
Walvisch Bay, carrying every rag they could
crowd on her, seeing that every hour they were
out of port now on this unusual course was
brimful of danger. The skipper scarcely ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
left the deck, and his eyes were bleared and
burning with constant glaring through his glasses
for a possible pursuer.</p>

<p>H.M.S. <i>Scourge</i>, 22-knot cruiser, was on her
passage to Simon’s Town with urgent stores for
the squadron off that station. Her orders were—“All
possible dispatch,” yet, when the look-out one
afternoon reported a heavily-rigged four-master
standing to the eastward in latitude twenty-three
degrees south, her commander felt justified in
altering her course sufficiently to bring him in
touch with this phenomenon. The stranger was
making grand headway under all canvas to a
heavy south-east Trade, but the speed of the cruiser
was fully two knots to her one. In about an
hour, therefore, from sighting her, the <i>Scourge</i>
ranged sufficiently near to inquire by signal for
the usual information. But the merchantman was
so slow with his answers that before two sets had
been hoisted the vessels were within hail of each
other. “Where are you bound to?” roared the
commander of the cruiser. A dramatic pause
succeeded, in which all eyes on board both ships
were centred upon the skipper of the <i>St. George</i>.
At last the reluctant answer came, “Walvisch
Bay.” “The devil you are,” said the naval
captain; “I must have a closer look at you.” A
couple of abrupt orders, and a well-manned cutter,
with the first-lieutenant in charge, was bounding
across the few fathoms of sea towards the <i>St.
George</i>, with instructions to ascertain the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
facts of this mystery. Arriving alongside, the
officer sprang on board, and, quickly mounting the
poop, confronted Captain Schwartz, whose face was
a study of conflicting emotions. Already the
lieutenant had noticed the Teutonic appearance of
everybody on deck, and the captain’s working face
deepened the suspicions aroused. “I wish to
examine your papers, sir,” said he quietly to the
scowling skipper. “Vat for, sir?” was the almost
expected reply. For all answer the lieutenant
strode to the side and blew a small whistle, which
brought six of his boat’s crew bounding on board
in an instant. “Now, sir,” he said, turning again
to the skipper, “my time is precious, and my
orders precise. Kindly lead the way into your
cabin, and produce your documents, or I must
search for them without you.” The baffled
Teuton still hesitating, the naval officer, with a
slight gesture of impatience, beckoned his men aft.
They came on the jump, but one of them stepping
forward in advance of his fellows, saluted, and
said, “Beg pardon, sir, but we just heard some
voices forrard a-cryin’ ‘Help!’ and it sounded’s
if they wus cooped up somewheres.” A dark
frown settled upon the officer’s face as he replied,
sternly, “Three of you go forrard and search; the
others come below here with me.” But before he
stepped into the companion-way he blew two sharp
notes on his whistle, a signal which was immediately
answered by the cruiser sending another cutter
alongside with a fully-armed crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>In the meantime the search aft had revealed the
ship’s papers, which showed of course that the
<i>St. George</i> had cleared from London for Melbourne.
The skipper’s private journal in German was also
impounded. With the documents under his arm
the lieutenant returned on deck, just as the search
party forward emerged from the fore-peak bringing
their hapless countrymen to light. Orders
were immediately issued to place all the foreigners
under arrest, but the skipper was nowhere to be
seen. A search for him was ordered at once, but
the words had hardly been spoken when, with an
awful roar, the whole beautiful fabric was rent into
a myriad fragments; an immense volume of dense
smoke rose sullenly into the clear air, and the
sparkling sea was bestrewn with the mangled
remains of friend and foe alike.</p>

<p>The desperate skipper had chosen, rather than
give up his ill-gotten prize, to fire the great store
of powder under the main-hatch, involving himself
and his captors in one awful fate. A great wave
raised by the gigantic explosion made even the
stately cruiser roll and stagger as if in a heavy
gale, but all her boats were in the water in a trice
making search for any trace of life among the
wreckage.</p>

<p>Not one was saved, and with a company of
heavy-hearted men she resumed her passage bearing
the terrible news of the loss of the <i>St. George</i>.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRUTH ABOUT THE
MERCHANT SERVICE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">At</span> intervals, ever since the issue of the last report
of the Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen,
there have been appearing in the press items of
comment upon the significant tables set forth in
that most interesting document. But one feature
has been painfully evident in all of them—the
inability to appreciate, from a merchant seaman’s
point of view, the underlying lessons that report
contained.</p>

<p>This, though much to be regretted, can scarcely
be wondered at when we remember the limitations,
the inarticulateness, of the class referred to. Here
it may be as well to state that in what follows the
terms “ship,” “officer,” and “seaman,” are to be
understood as referring solely to the Mercantile
Marine, unless otherwise stated—a necessary warning,
since eight out of every ten landsmen always
confound the two services, mercantile and naval.</p>

<p>First in importance, as well as in interest, to
seamen is the question of personnel. It is much
to the credit of the Navy League that it is wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
awake to the dangers besetting this country
through the increasing numbers of foreign seamen
manning our ships. But it does not appear as if
even the Navy League fully realises to what extent
our cargo-carriers have been handed over to the
foreigner. A very extended acquaintance with
the various trades is absolutely necessary in order
to understand the reason why the percentages
shown in the Board of Trade return do not reveal
the true state of affairs. As they stand, the percentage
of foreign able-seamen to British (excluding
Lascars) in foreign-going sailing ships is shown
to be as high as 48.6. Taking steam and sailing
ships together, the percentage falls to 35.5, for
reasons which will presently appear. Now, one
would naturally expect (what proves indeed to be
the case) that our coasters and fishermen would be
almost entirely British. And we may go a step
further, and declare that these hardy fellows are
the fine flower of our seamen, as stalwart and
capable as ever British seamen were. With them
may be classed the fishermen, hovellers, and beachmen
generally of our coasts, who, though not
classed as seamen, may fearlessly challenge comparison
with any seafarers in the wide world.
Among all these the foreigner finds little or no
room wherein to thrust himself, nor is there apparently
much danger that he ever will. Next to
these in order of immunity from foreign interference
come the great steamship lines, other than
those trading to the Far East, whose crews are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
almost exclusively composed of Lascars and Chinese,
with British officers. To the former belong such
great undertakings as the “Cunard,” the “Union,”
the “Castle,” and the “Pacific” Companies. In
these splendid vessels the Britisher tenaciously
holds his own, in whatever part of the ship you
seek him. The food is good, pay is fair, accommodation
is comfortable, and a high state of
discipline is maintained. Consequently, these ships
are eagerly sought after by the better class of
seamen, who will be found making voyage after
voyage in the same vessel, or at least in the same
line.</p>

<p>But having thus briefly dismissed the almost
exclusively British-manned branches of the Mercantile
Marine, we are met by a vastly different
state of affairs at once.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ocean Tramps</span></h3>

<p>Go to one of the shipping offices when a sailing
ship is “signing on,” and watch the skipper’s
contemptuous look as he scrutinises a steamboat
man’s discharge just handed to him. “I want
sailors, not navvies,” he shouts, as he scornfully
flings it back. Therefore a “sailor man,” gives
them a wide berth if he can. And then the conditions
of life on board these tanks effectually bar
decent Britons out of them. The few that are
found in them generally belong to that unhappy
class of men who get drunk at every opportunity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
and must go when their money is done in whatever
presents itself. They would sail in a sieve with
the devil for a skipper. The rule is, however, for
these vessels to be manned by a motley crowd of
what Jack calls “dagoes,”—Latins of all kinds, the
scum of the Levant, with a sprinkling of Scandinavians,
but not many. It speaks volumes for the
skill and pluck of the officers unfortunate enough
to be responsible for such ships, that so few casualties
occur in comparison with their number; for
it is no uncommon thing for a tramp of a thousand
tons or so to be wallowing along through a pitch-black
night, the whole watch on deck consisting of
the officer in charge and three men, no one of
whom is able to understand the other. One is at
the wheel, one is on the look-out, and the other
“stands by to never mind.” The kennel below is
filthy,—a parti-coloured halo round the reeking
grease-pot that serves for a lamp eloquently
testifying to the condition of the atmosphere.
The food is in keeping with the rest, where provided
by the ship; but in a large number of cases
these are “weekly boats,”; that is, the men are
paid by the week and “find” themselves,—an
arrangement that lends itself to some extraordinary
developments of mixed messes and semi-starvation
among such a strange medley of races. I knew
a weekly boat once that signed in London for
a Mediterranean voyage, but was chartered in
Smyrna to take pilgrims to Jeddah. The fellows
cut their purchases very fine, as it was for the trip,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
but owing to their stores being stolen by the
starving pilgrims, they were in such a plight when
they left Suez that it was a miracle they did not
share the fate of fifty-five of their passengers, who
resigned their pilgrimage on the passage, and found
rest among the sharks. Other things happened,
too, more true than tellable, which would almost
serve as an appendix to the <i>Inferno</i>. These vessels
are mostly owned by single-ship companies, a
dozen or so of which will be managed by some
enterprising broker, who makes a fortune, although
the shareholders rarely see dividends. Under such
conditions of ownership there is no room for
wonder that these tramps are what they are.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Much Canvas and Few Men</span></h3>

<p>Many intelligent people are possessed by the
idea that steam is rapidly driving the sailing-ship
from the sea. If they would only take a stroll
round the docks they would alter their views.
For certain trades and some kinds of cargo the
steamer, let her be built, found, and manned as
cheaply as the ’cutest single-ship manager can
contrive, cannot possibly compete with the sailing-ship.
And of late years it has been found possible
to add enormously to the size of sailing-ships
without increasing the cost of their working to
any extent. Four-masted ships have become
plentiful, carrying an area of canvas which would
have seemed incredible to the seamen of fifty years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
ago, accustomed as they were to the flying clippers
of Britain and America. These vessels are as handsome
as the tramp steamer is hideous, their graceful
lines, taut spars, and spidery rigging all lending
themselves to beauty. But in these, as in the
tramps, the foreigner is paramount. The ghastly
farce (to a sailor) of labour-saving appliances has
enabled the owners to reduce the crew lists to
such an extent that in the majority of these ships
all hands are barely enough for an efficient watch.
The only change which has been found workable
in the management of the larger sails above the
courses is an American invention. It consists of
splitting a sail in half horizontally, and was long
applied to the topsails only, their unwieldy depth
having always made them exceedingly difficult to
handle. With the growth in size of ships and
sails the top-gallant-sails have been also halved,
and this alteration is now very general. But the
comparative ease with which these sails can be
handled, as compared with what used to be the
case, has naturally tempted officers anxious to make
a passage to “hang on,” longer than they used to,
depending upon their ability to get sail in quickly
at the last moment. That was all very well when
a crew was carried sufficient in numbers to do
what was required of them. But when eight such
struggling monsters as a 3000-ton ship’s to’gallant-s’ls
are have to be furled at once in a gale of wind
by eighteen men (supposing all hands are called),
it is quite another matter. Few experiences are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
more awful than those gained by being on a yard
with a handful of men trying to master two or
three thousand yards of No. 1 canvas in what
sailors call a “breeze of wind,”—off the Horn,
for instance, in a blinding snowstorm, with the
canvas like a plank for stiffness, and rising far
above your head in a solid round of white, into
which you vainly try to force your half-frozen
fingers.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dutchman</span></h3>

<p>There is a great temptation to enlarge upon
this theme, but it must be sternly suppressed, my
object being solely to show how a scanty crew
list adds to the miseries of the sailor. Not only
so, but the food is so uniformly, unpardonably
bad that British seamen will not put up with it
a day longer than they can help. They get out
of it the first opportunity that presents itself, and
the Dutchman, as Jack impartially designates
Germans and Scandinavians alike, comes in. In
such vessels as I have been describing he is found
in a proportion of at least 85 per cent. And not
only as common seamen, but as officers, masters,
mates, and tradesmen. In these ships are to be
found the 180 captains, 512 mates, 637 boatswains,
1304 carpenters, 277 sailmakers, and 2321 cooks
and stewards of foreign birth admittedly sailing in
British vessels, according to the Registrar-General.
A very potent reason for this is to be found in the
peculiar conditions of discipline, or rather want of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
discipline, obtaining on board these ships. Bad
food, short-handedness, and miserable quarters
make British Jack, never too amenable to discipline,
kick over the traces. When he does, which
is not infrequently, what remedy has his superior
officer? Practically none. Handcuffs are carried,
but with an all too scanty crew already that
coercive measure is barred. American methods
of “booting” and “belaying-pin soup” are also
out of the question, for Jack knows enough of
the Merchant Shipping Act to make him a dangerous
customer to assault. Personal violence towards
a seaman on the high seas renders an officer liable
to lose his certificate, even if he gets a present
advantage in the sudden civility of the person
assaulted. Again, the scanty number of officers
carried in proportion to the crew is a powerful
argument against the use of physical force. So
dangerous a weapon ought never to be used at
sea unless it is sure to be effectual. And yet,
failing personal violence, there are no means by
which an officer can enforce obedience to his
orders. Refusal to obey orders, often accompanied
by the foulest abuse, is one of the commonest of
experiences at sea in British sailing ships, for which
gross outrage the master’s only legal remedy is
to note the offence in the official log, and on the
ship’s arrival in port get a magistrate to sanction
fining the offender a portion of his pay varying
from two days’ to a month’s wages.</p>

<p>Between British seamen anxious to leave the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
sea and captains eager to ship Dutchmen, the
miserable remnant of our countrymen manning
“deep-water” ships steadily dwindles. Those
that remain are mostly like Sterne’s starling, or
else they are hopeful youngsters who, having
served their time in some singly-owned hooker,
and passed for second mate, sail before the mast
in hope of picking up a berth abroad. They cannot
live at home in idleness wearing away the dock
roads looking for berths which are all filled up
by those possessing influence of some kind with
the owners, so they put in their time as A.B.s
and live in hope. This, however, is not all.
Not content with supplying our forecastles, the
Dutchmen kindly furnish us with officers as well.
I have been before the mast in a ship, the <i>Orpheus</i>
of Greenock, where the chief mate was a Liverpool
man, who, with a Welsh A.B. and myself, represented
the entire British element on board.
Her crew numbered twenty-four all told. Doubtless
I shall hear that this was a marvellously
exceptional case, but I beg to differ—it is all too
common.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The “Boy”</span></h3>

<p>Another curious feature of the manning of our
ships is especially noticed by the Registrar-General—the
way in which young British seamen leave
the sea-life at the earliest opportunity. His unemotional
remark, that “as ‘sailors’ do not ordinarily
enter the sea-service after they are twenty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
years of age, this falling off in the number of its
young British sailors affects the source of supply of
our future petty officers and able seamen,” is full
of the gravest warning, which has, however, apparently
passed unheeded. Out of the various training
ships<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> there pass every year a very large number
of lads into the mercantile marine, who have
received at least an insight into the conditions of
a sailor’s life as it should be. They are taught
habits of obedience, cleanliness, and regularity,
and in some cases have actual acquaintance with
the working of small vessels under way. When
they are considered to be fairly competent to do
all that is likely to be required of them, they are
taken in hand by an official whose duty it is to
find ships for them. In due time they sign as
“boys,” generally in sailing ships, and away they
go to sea. To their utter amazement they find
the life has scarcely anything in common with that
which they have been used to. In the first place,
they miss most painfully the abundance of good
plain food. Then they have been used to cleanliness
of the strictest kind, both in body and
clothes. Now they are fortunate if they can
obtain the eighth share of a bucket of fresh water
once a week, unless rain falls. Their duties have
been regular, their periods of rest unbroken; now
they have as many masters as there are hands on
board, and they never know what to do next.
They have been under a regular system of tuition;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
now, if they learn anything, it is because they are
determined to do so in spite of difficulties which
are only to be overcome by such indomitable
perseverance as one can hardly expect from a boy.
And lastly, they are thrown into the intimate
society of a group of men who, generally speaking,
have but one topic of conversation, one mode of
speech—the worst possible. They are continually
being told that nobody but a fool goes to sea, that
it is the life of a convict, with worse food and
lodging, and that they had better sweep a crossing
ashore. Consequently they are ever on the look-out
for a way of escape, and the great majority
succeed in finding one before very long.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> This does not apply to cadet ships, such as the <i>Worcester</i> and <i>Conway</i>.</p>

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Naval Reserve</span></h3>

<p>This brings me to a most important part of the
subject, the question of merchant seamen as a
reserve for the Navy. There can be no doubt that
the institution of the Royal Naval Reserve was a
grand idea, but there are grave doubts as to the
way in which it is being carried out. As far as its
officers are concerned, its success can hardly be
disputed, though there may be more truth than is
palatable in the assertion that Naval officers look
down with much contempt upon the gallant
merchantmen who become R.N.R. lieutenants.
Whether that be so or not, I am sure that Naval
officers would be the first to recognise the value
of R.N.R lieutenants if ever their services were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
needed, and any lingering feeling of superiority
would soon give place to admiration. But the
men, the rank and file, who are each paid a substantial
retaining fee yearly, besides a guinea a week
for six weeks’ annual drill? I speak under correction
as trenching upon a matter with which I
have had small acquaintance, but I believe that
drill is usually put in on board of an ancient hulk,
with obsolete weapons, and that very few of the
men have any acquaintance whatever with the
actual conditions of service on board a sea-going
vessel of war. If I am right in this contention,
then this most valuable body of men are running
to waste, and would be no more fit to take their
places on board a man-o’-war than they would be
to start cabinet-making. And if this be so in the
case of Royal Naval Reserve men, what can be
said of those outside that experimental force?
Except that he would be hardly likely to get seasick,
the merchant seaman suddenly transferred to
(let us say) a first-class battleship would feel as
much out of his element as any landsman, more
so than an engine-fitter or a man accustomed to
some of our big machine-shops. To use the same
words, but in a very different sense, that I used
about the tramp-steamer crews, a man-of-warsman
(blue-jacket) is not a sailor at all now. He is a
marine artilleryman with a fine knowledge of boat
handling, but a spanner is fitter for his fist than a
marlinspike. He lives in the heart of a bewildering
complication of engineering contrivances, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
which the mazy web of a sailing-ship’s top hamper
is as simple as a child’s box of bricks. He is
accustomed to the manipulation of masses of metal
so huge as to excite the awe-stricken wonder of
the ordinary citizen who is not an engineer. And
familiarity with packages of death-dealing explosives
renders him as contemptuously indifferent to their
potentialities of destruction as if they were sand or
sawdust. And, most important of all, long and
rigid training has made him one of the smartest
men in the world, able to act at the word of command
like a pinion in a machine, at the right
moment, in the right way, yet with that intelligence
no machine can ever possess.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Intelligent Foreigner</span></h3>

<p>Talk about the average merchant seamen filling
up gaps in the ranks of men like these is almost
too much for one’s patience on the part of those
whose business it is to know; it is criminal stupidity.
Now in France every merchant seaman must
perforce spend a large proportion of his time in
the Navy, so that their reserve is always available.
And that is one reason why France strives so
eagerly to foster her Mercantile Marine even at
such crushing cost to her long-suffering taxpayers.
In the event of war with us, however, she would
be in a far different position, because she could
exist without a merchant ship at sea, and all their
crews would be ready for service in the Navy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
What should we do? Even supposing that all
our merchant seamen were capable of taking their
places on board of men-of-war if called upon, who
would man the fleets of food-carriers? Accepting
as rigidly correct the proportions shown by the
official document already quoted, the percentage of
foreign seamen in all foreign-going vessels was
two years ago 35.5, and admittedly increasing
rapidly. Would it be wise to withdraw from the
merchant ships the stiffening of British subjects
they now carry and replace them by aliens? I
firmly believe that the danger limit has long been
passed in the exclusively cargo-carrying trades,
which, after all, are our very backbone. What this
great army of aliens will do in the event of our
going to war with one or two European Powers
is a problem of undeniable gravity. But given a
fine ship with a valuable cargo, with officers and
crew nearly all German, what might they reasonably
be expected to do? Failing an answer, I submit
that the temptation to transfer the ship to their
own flag would be very great. And it is a needless
risk. Let it be granted that the alien officer
or skipper is a good man, better educated most
likely, a good seaman, and that he is cheap. All
these qualities except the educational one (which is,
after all, not so important to our officers as it is to
the foreigner) our officers possess in just as great
measure, while as for the price—well, I have seen
half-a-dozen chief mates tumbling over one another
for the chance of shipping in a 1200-ton Baltic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
tramp steamer at <span class="locked">£5 : 10s.</span> a month. They could
not be much cheaper than that, unless they got
the same wages as the crew. And I know of
English skippers of sea-going steamers out of
London who are getting £10 a month. Poor
men, they are cheap enough!</p>

<p>To sum up as briefly as possible all the foregoing
remarks: It seems clear to me, as it has done to
all intelligent seamen that I have ever met, that
very little legislation is needed to make the British
Mercantile Marine popular again among our own
countrymen. Legislation has hitherto done little
for the sailor, while it has exasperated the shipowner,
already handicapped as none of his foreign
rivals have ever been. The Mercantile Marine
should more nearly approximate to the Navy in
many of its details, which need not entail extra
expense or annoyance to the shipowner. It should
be made possible for a shipmaster to ensure better
discipline, but he should be able to give his men
better food and better housing. The Board of
Trade scale of provisions is a hateful abomination;
it ought to be blotted out and a sensible dietary
substituted, which need not exceed it in cost, while
it would act like a charm upon seamen, for whom
it has an importance undreamed of by those ashore,
who even on the slenderest incomes can fare every
day in a manner luxurious by comparison with our
sailors. More attention should be paid to the
men’s quarters. Here, again, expenses need not
be raised; a little attention to detail in drawing up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
specifications would make a vast difference. <em>And
none but a naturalised British subject should be
permitted to sign articles in a British ship.</em> This
plan is pursued with advantage in American vessels,
which, like our own, carry an enormous percentage
of foreigners of all nations. Of undermanning I
need say nothing more, because the question is
being dealt with, and will, I earnestly hope, be
settled with as much satisfaction to everybody
concerned as the splendid “Midge” scheme, the
only piece of marine legislation that I can remember
that has been completely successful.
Unfortunately, under present conditions it is responsible
for the still further depletion of our
Mercantile Marine of British seamen, since numbers
of them by its beneficent operations reach their
homes with their hard-earned pay intact. This
enables them to look about for a job ashore where
they are known, whereas under the bad old conditions
they would have been in a few days again
“outward bound with a stocking round their
necks,” as Jack tersely sums up the situation of a
man who has squandered all his money, been
robbed of, or has sold, all his clothes, and is off to
sea again in the first craft that he can get, going
he neither knows nor cares whither.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">There</span> is a tiny islet on the outskirts of the
Solomon Archipelago that to all such casual
wanderers as stray so far presents not a single
feature of interest. Like scores of others in those
latitudes, it has not yet attained to the dignity of
a single coco-nut tree, although many derelict
nuts have found a lodgment upon it, and begun
to grow, only to be wiped out of existence at the
next spring-tide. Viewed from a balloon it
would look like a silly-season mushroom, but with
a fringe of snowy foam around it marking the
protecting barrier to which it owes its existence, to
say nothing of its growth. Yet of all places in
the world which I have been privileged to visit,
this barren little mound of sand clings most
tenaciously to my memory, for reasons which will
presently appear.</p>

<p>One of those devastating cyclones that at long
intervals sweep across the Pacific, leaving a long
swath of destruction in their wake, had overtaken
the pearling schooner of which I was mate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
For twenty-four hours we fled before it, we knew
not whither, not daring to heave-to. The only
compass we possessed had been destroyed by the
first sea that broke on board. Whether it was
night or day we had no notion, except by watch,
and even then we were doubtful, so appalling was
the darkness. Hope was beginning to revive
that, as the <i>Papalangi</i> had proved herself so
staunch, she might yet “run it out,” unless she
hit something. But the tiny rag rigged forrard to
keep her before it suddenly flew into threads; the
curl of the sea caught her under the counter and
spun her up into the wind like a teetotum. The
next vast comber took her broadside-on, rolled her
over, and swallowed her up. We went “down
quick into the pit.”</p>

<p>Although always reckoned a powerful swimmer,
even among such amphibia as the Kanakas, I don’t
remember making a stroke. But after a horrible,
choking struggle in the black uproar I got my
breath again, finding myself clinging, as a drowning
man will, to something big and seaworthy. It
was an ordinary ship’s hencoop that the skipper
had bought cheap from a passenger vessel in
Auckland. As good a raft as one could wish, it
bore me on over the mad sea, half dead as I was,
until I felt it rise high as if climbing a cataract
and descend amidst a furious boiling of surf into
calm, smooth water. A few minutes later I
touched a sandy beach. Utterly done up, I slept
where I lay, at the water’s edge, though the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
shrieking hurricane raged overhead as if it would
tear the land up by the roots.</p>

<p>When I awoke it was fine weather, though to
leeward the infernal reek of the departing meteor
still disfigured a huge segment of the sky. I
looked around, and my jaw dropped. Often I had
wondered what a poor devil <em>would</em> do who
happened to be cast away on such a spot as this.
Apparently I was about to learn. A painful
pinch at my bare foot startled me, and I saw an
ugly beast of a crab going for me. He was
nearly a foot across, his blue back covered with
long spikes, and his wicked little eyes seemed to
have an expression of diabolical malignity. I
snatched at a handful of his legs and swung him
round my head, dashing him against the side of
my coop with such vigour that his armour flew to
flinders around me. I never have liked crab, even
when dressed, but I found the raw flesh of that one
tasty enough—it quite smartened me up. Having
eaten heartily, I took a saunter up the smooth
knoll of sand, aimlessly, I suppose, for it was as
bare as a plate, without a stone or a shell. From
its highest point, about ten feet above high-water
mark, I looked around, but my horizon was
completely bounded by the ring of breakers aforesaid.
I felt like the scorpion within the fiery
circle, and almost as disposed to sting myself to
death had I possessed the proper weapon. As I
stood gazing vacantly at the foaming barrier and
solemn enclosing dome of fleckless blue, I was again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
surprised by a vicious nip at my foot. There was
another huge crab boldly attacking me—me, a
vigorous man, and not a sodden corpse, as yet. I
felt a grue of horror run all down my back, but I
grabbed at the vile thing and hurled it from me
half across the island. Then I became aware of
others arriving, converging upon me from all
around, and I was panic-stricken. For one mad
moment I thought of plunging into the sea again;
but reason reasserted itself in time, reminding me
that, while I had certain advantages on my side
where I was, in the water I should fall a helpless
victim at once, if, as might naturally be expected,
these ghouls were swarming there. Not a weapon
of any kind could I see, neither stick nor stone.
My feelings of disgust deepened into despair. But
I got little time for thought. Such a multitude of
the eerie things were about me that I was kept
most actively employed seizing them and flinging
them from me. They got bolder, feinting and
dodging around me, but happily without any
definite plan of campaign among them. Once I
staggered forward, having trodden unaware upon
a spiky back as I sprung aside, wounding my foot
badly. I fell into a group of at least twenty,
crushing some of them, but after a painful struggle
among those needle-like spines regained my feet
with several clinging to my body. A kind of
frenzy seized me, and, regardless of pain, I
clutched at them right and left, dashing them to
fragments one against the other, until quite a pile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
of writhing, dismembered enemies lay around me,
while my hands and arms were streaming from
numberless wounds. Very soon I became exhausted
by my violent exertions and the intense
heat, but, to my unfathomable thankfulness, the
heap of broken crabs afforded me a long respite,
the sound ones finding congenial occupation in
devouring them. While I watched the busy
cannibals swarming over the yet writhing heap, I
became violently ill, for imagination vividly depicted
them rioting in my viscera. Vertigo seized
me, I reeled and fell prone, oblivious to all things
for a time.</p>

<p>When sense returned it was night. The broad
moon was commencing her triumphal march among
the stars, which glowed in the blue-black concave
like globules of incandescent steel. My body was
drenched with dew, a blessed relief, for my tongue
was leathery and my lips were split with drouth.
I tore off my shirt and sucked it eagerly, the
moisture it held, though brackish, mitigating my
tortures of thirst. Suddenly I bethought me of
my foes, and looked fearfully around. There was
not one to be seen, nothing near but the heap of
clean-picked shells of those devoured. As the
moon rose higher, I saw a cluster of white objects
at a little distance, soon recognisable as boobies.
They permitted me to snatch a couple of them
easily, and wringing off their heads I got such a
draught as put new life into me. Hope returned,
even quelling the cruel thought of daylight bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
again those ravening hordes of crawling
crustacea. Yet my position was almost as hopeless
as one could imagine. Unless, as I much doubted,
this was a known spot for <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bêche de mer</i> or pearl-shell
fishers, there was but the remotest chance of
my rescue, while, without anything floatable but
my poor little hencoop, passing that barrier of
breakers was impossible. Fortunately I have
always tried to avoid meeting trouble half-way,
and with a thankful feeling of present wants
supplied, I actually went to sleep again, though
stiff and sore from head to heel.</p>

<p>At daybreak I awoke again to a repetition of
the agonies of the previous day, which, although I
was better fortified to meet them, were greater
than before. The numbers of my hideous assailants
were more than doubled as far I could judge.
The whole patch of sand seemed alive with the
voracious vermin. So much so that when I saw
the approach of those horrible hosts my heart sank,
my flesh shrank on my bones, and I clutched at
my throat. But I could not strangle myself,
though had I possessed a knife I should certainly
have chosen a swift exit from the unutterable
horror of my position, fiercely as I clung to life.
To be devoured piecemeal, retaining every faculty
till the last—I could not bear the thought. There
was no time for reflection, however; the struggle
began at once and continued with a pertinacity on
the part of the crabs that promised a speedy end
to it for me. How long it lasted I have no idea—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
my tortured mind it was an eternity. At last,
overborne, exhausted, surrounded by mounds of
those I had destroyed, over which fresh legions
poured in ever-increasing numbers, earth and sky
whirled around me, and I fell backward. As I
went, with many of the vile things already clinging
to me, I heard a yell—a human voice that revived
my dulling senses like a galvanic shock. With
one last flash of vigour I sprang to my feet, seeing
as I did so a canoe with four Kanakas in it, not
fifty yards away, in the smooth water between the
beach and the barrier. Bounding like a buck,
heedless of the pain as my wounded feet clashed
among the innumerable spiky carapaces of my
enemies, I reached the water, and hurled myself
headlong towards that ark of safety. How I
reached it I do not know, nor anything further
until I returned to life again on board the <i>Warrigal</i>
of Sydney, as weak as a babe and feeling a century
older.</p>

<span class="subhead">A NINETEENTH-CENTURY
JONAH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> were gathered together in a compact group
under the weather bulwarks of the old <i>Rainbow</i>,
South Sea-man, presently cruising on the Line
grounds; officers and harpooners of three ships
engaged in the pleasant occupation of “gamming,”
as ship-visiting is termed among Southern-going
whalemen. Song and dance were finished, and
with pipes aglow, stretched at our ease, the time-honoured
“cuffer” or yarn was going its soothing
round.</p>

<p>The fourth officer of the <i>Rainbow</i>, a taciturn
Englishman, whose speech and manner excited
wonder as to how he came in that galley, was
called upon in his turn to contribute. Without
hesitation, as if professional story-telling was his
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">métier</i>, he began:</p>

<p>“‘’Ere she white water-r-rs! Ah blo-o-ow!’
came ringing down from the main crow’s nest of
the <i>Megantic</i>, South Sea whaler of Martha’s
Vineyard, as she heeled solemnly to the steady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
trade on the ‘off-shore’ ground one lovely
morning.</p>

<p>“‘Where away? Haow fer off?’ roared the
skipper, while, slinging his glasses, he prepared
to elevate his sixteen stone painfully to the giddy
height above him.</p>

<p>“‘Two p’ints on the starb’rd baouw, sir, ’baout
five mile off. Looks like sparm whale, sir,’ was
the prompt reply.</p>

<p>“‘All right, keep her az she goes, Mr. Slocum,
’n’ clar away boats,’ said the ‘old man,’ as with
many a grunt he began his pilgrimage of pain.</p>

<p>“There was no need to call all hands. The
first cry had startled them into sudden activity.
Before its echoes died away, they were on deck,
with no trace of drowsiness among them. Being
in a high state of discipline, each man went straight
to his boat, standing ready, at the word, to lower
and be off after the gambolling leviathan ahead.
Silence reigned profound, except for the soothing
murmur of the displaced sea as the lumbering old
barky forged slowly ahead, or the soft flap of a
hardly-drawing staysail as she rolled to windward.
Seated upon the upper topsail yard, the ‘old man’
soliloquised grumblingly, ‘What in the ’tarnal
blazes ’s he doin’ of? Gaul bust my gol-dern
skin ef ever <em>I</em> see sech a ninseck ’n <em>my</em> life. I be
everlastin’ly frazzled ef ’taint mos’ ’s bad ez
snakes in yer boots. Mr. Slocum, jes’ shin up
hyar a minit, won’t ye?’</p>

<p>“As if unable to trust his own senses any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
longer, he thus called upon the mate to help him
out. More agile than the skipper in his movements,
it was but a few seconds before Mr. Slocum
was by his chief’s side, peering with growing
bewilderment through the binoculars at the strange
object ahead. What had at first sight seemed
an ordinary full-sized bull cachalot leisurely
playing upon the surface of the sea, had now
resolved itself into an indescribable, ever-shifting
mass of matter, from the dark centre of which
writhing arms continually protruded and retreated.
The golden glare lavished along the glittering sea
by the ascending sun added to the mystery surrounding
the moving monster or monsters, for
it or they lay right in the centre of that dazzling
path.</p>

<p>“‘Wall—whatjer mek ov it, Mr. Slocum?’
queried the skipper sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Slowly, as if spelling his words, the mate
replied, ‘Thutty-nine year hev I ben a-fishin’, but
ef ever I see ennythin’ like <em>that</em> befo’, may I never
pump sparm whale ag’in. Kaint fine no sorter
name fer it, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Lemme see them glasses agen,’ said the ‘old
man’ wearily. ‘’Pears like ’s if she’s a-risin’ it,
whatever ’tes, consider’ble sudden;’ and, readjusting
the focus, he glued his eyes to the tubes
again for another long searching look at the
uncanny sight. His scrutiny was evidently more
satisfying than at first, for without removing the
glasses from his eyes, he yapped, ‘’Way down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
frum aloft! Heave to, ’n low’r away, Mr. Slocum.
Guess yew’ll fine a “fish” thar, er tharabout.’</p>

<p>“‘Ay, ay, sir,’ promptly returned the mate,
departing with great alacrity, issuing orders the
while, so that by the time he reached the deck
there was a whirring rattle of patent sheaves, and
a succession of subdued splashes, as boat after boat
took the water. In almost as short a time as it
takes to say it, the boats’ masts were stepped,
the big sails bellied out, and away sped the handsome
craft, in striking contrast to the unlovely old
hulk that had borne them.</p>

<p>“We were no ‘greenies’; long practice had so
familiarised us with the wiles and ferocity of the
cachalot, that we had none of the tremors at
approaching one that so sorely afflict beginners.
Nevertheless there was an air of mystery about the
present proceedings which affected all of us more
or less, though no one knew precisely why.
Absolute silence is the invariable rule, as you know,
in boats going on a ‘fish,’ because of that exquisite
sense of sound possessed by the sperm whale,
which is something more than hearing; so we
were slightly startled to hear our harpooner say in
a clear undertone, ‘Dern funny-lookin’ fish that,
Mr. Slocum, don’t ye think?’ But for all answer
our chief growled, ‘Stand up, José!’</p>

<p>“Instantly the big fellow sprang to his feet in
attitude to strike, balancing his weapon, a heroic
figure sharply outlined against the clear blue.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! what was that? A horrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
medley of blue-black and livid white, an inextricable
tangle of writhing, clutching, tearing, serpent-like
arms, that lashed the sea into a curious dusky foam,
evil-smelling and greasy. Out of its midst rose
an immense globular mass, bearing two eyes larger
than barrel-heads, dead black, yet with a Satanic
expression that confused one’s heart-beats.</p>

<p>“‘Giv’t to him! giv’t to him!’ roared the
mate, and instantly the iron flew into the midst of
the wallowing entanglement, followed immediately
by another from José’s eager, nervous arms.
Willing hands clutched the flapping sail to roll it
up, but a shriek of agony paralysed them all. A
long livid thing rose on the off side of the boat,
and twining itself around the wretched harpooner’s
tall figure, tore him from our midst, his heartbroken
death-yell curdling our blood. Quick as
thought, another of those awful arms came gliding
over us, this time encircling the boat amidships.
Though tapering to the slenderest of points, it was
of the circumference of a man’s body at its thickest,
and armed with saucer-like mouths all along its
inferior surface. One of these clung to my bare
breast as the slimy horror tightened round us,
a ring of great curved claws which protruded from
it tearing at my flesh as if to strip it from the
bones. But we had hardly realised what was
happening, when she was going over, parbuckled
as you might turn a hand-bowl. In a moment all
was darkness and struggle for breath amidst a very
maelström of slime and stench, in the depths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
which I felt myself freed from that frightful grip.
It seemed like hours before, with a bound, I reached
the surface again, clutching at something hard and
floating as I rose. In spite of the excruciating
agony of my wounds, and the rushing of the air
into my collapsed lungs, there was a sense of relief
beyond expression, as of resurrection from the
dead.</p>

<p>“Although counted a good swimmer even
among such amphibia as our crew, I lay there
supine, stretched at length upon the sea—a still,
white figure grasping numbly at the fragment of
bottom-board. Suddenly I became aware of a
whirling in the water again, but I was in a sort of
stupor of the physical faculties, though mentally
alert enough.</p>

<p>“Then up reared above my head an object I
recognised with a long wail of terror; the
tremendous lower jaw of the sperm whale, bristling
with its double row of gleaming teeth. Before
I could gasp a prayer, or even think what was
happening, I was gliding down the vast grey
cavern of his throat, with but one thought left—‘the
descent into Hell is easy.’ Down, down I
went into utter darkness, among a squirming,
fetid heap of snaky coils, that enveloped me, and
seemed to gnaw and tear at my shuddering body
as if devouring me at second hand. Then came
an explosion—a dull, rending report that sent an
earthquake shock through me and my unutterable
surroundings. Immediately following this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
there was a convulsive upheaval, in which all the
contents of that awful place took a rising motion,
growing faster and faster, until, with a roaring
rush, came the dear daylight again.</p>

<p>“What ensued then for some time I do not
know. A sensation of heavenly peace and calm
possessed me, when, as if released from some
unimaginable nightmare, I found myself floating
placidly as a Medusa upon a calm sea. There I
felt content to lie, without effort, conscious only
of life—life so sweet that I wondered dreamily
whether I was still in the body, or had passed
into that blissful state imagined by speculative
psychologists as awaiting man after death. Gradually
my mind became clearer, my limbs felt willing
to obey the impulse of my brain. I began to
swim, feebly at first, almost automatically, but
with increasing vigour as the significance of my
position became clearer to me.</p>

<p>“I had swum but a short distance when the
blessed sound of my shipmates’ voices greeted my
ears, but from my lowly position I was unable to
see them, until one of them gripped me by the
arms, dragging me into the boat among them.</p>

<p>“Then I learned without surprise that I was
the only survivor of my boat’s crew. Every one
of my fellows had disappeared before the horror-stricken
gaze of the men in the other boats, who,
being but a short distance astern of us, had
witnessed the whole tragedy. It appeared that
we had attacked a cachalot in the act of devouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
one of the gigantic cuttle-fish, or ‘squid,’ upon
which these cetaceans feed, and of which it is most
probable no mortal eye has yet beheld a full-sized
specimen. For they inhabit the middle depths of
oceans, never coming to the surface voluntarily.</p>

<p>“This monster’s arms, or tentacles, enlaced the
whole colossal body of the whale, so that they
must have been fully 60 feet or 70 feet in length.
At their junction with the head they were about
5 feet in girth, as a huge fragment lying at the
bottom of the boat conclusively proved. At the
time we so rashly attacked the whale the mighty
mollusc must have been in his death-throes, for
immediately after our boat’s disappearance the
whale ‘sounded.’ When, a minute or two later,
he rose again to the surface, the other boats’ crews
saw him busily turning over and over, as if collecting
the scattered fragments of his late victim. At
that time they had not noticed me among the
various flotsam, but it must have been then that I
vanished down the capacious gullet of the voracious
cetacean. Fortunately for me they were furiously
bent upon attacking the whale, and so in some
degree avenging their slain shipmates.</p>

<p>“The second mate had loaded his bomb-gun
with an extra heavy charge, and at the same
moment that the harpooner darted his weapon the
bomb was discharged also. It penetrated the
cachalot’s lungs, inflicting a mortal wound by its
explosion therein, the noise of which was the shock
that I felt while in that horrible tomb. As is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
usual, in his dying agony the whale ejected the
whole contents of his stomach, by means of which
cataclysm I was expelled therefrom and restored
to the upper world once more. But had it not
been for long and severe practice in diving, taken
while pearl-fishing in Polynesia, enabling me to
compete successfully with Kanakas, who almost
live in the water, and even to outdo them at times,
I must have been suffocated. The only time I
was ever before so distressed for breath was in
Levuka, when mate of a schooner. Our anchor
fouled a rock in eight fathoms of water, and we
could by no means persuade any of our natives
to attempt its release. Rather than lose the fair
chance of sailing that day I tried the dangerous
task, succeeding after a desperate struggle, but
regaining the surface with blood streaming from
mouth, nose, and ears.</p>

<p>“I lay back in the stern-sheets of the boat
feeling cruelly exhausted, the pain of my ghastly
wound becoming continually more severe. But,
even pre-occupied as I was, I could hardly fail to
notice a want of cordiality towards me among my
shipmates. An uncomfortable silence prevailed,
depressing and unusual. It was not due to the
natural solemnity following upon the sudden loss
of five of our number, cut off in the prime of
their health and strength, for, until I had told
the wonderful story of my going down into Sheol,
their demeanour had been very different. I
looked appealingly and wonderingly from one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
the other, but could not meet any eye. They were
all furtively averted with intent to avoid my gaze.</p>

<p>“To my relief we reached the ship speedily.
I was assisted on board gently enough, and led aft
to where the skipper was roaming restlessly athwart
the quarter-deck, like a caged animal. I was
allowed to sit down while he examined me keenly
as to the occurrences of the day. The gloom
deepened on his face as I recounted all that I
could remember of the fate of my unfortunate
shipmates, until, my tale being told, he began, in
curt, half-angry fashion, to question me about my
antecedents. Not liking his manner, besides
feeling faint and ill, I gave him but little information
on that head.</p>

<p>“Then he burst out into petulant disconnected
sentences, in bitter regrets for the lost men, blame
of everybody generally, and at last, as if his
predominant thought could no longer be restrained,
shouted, ‘I wish ter God A’mighty I’d never seen
y’r face aboard my ship. Man an’ boy I b’en
spoutin’ fer over forty year, an’ never see, no, ner
hearn tell ov, sech a hell-fire turn out. Yew’r a
Jonah, thet’s wut yew air, an’ the sooner we get
shet ov ye the better it’ll be fer all han’s, an’ the
more likely we sh’l be to hev <em>some</em> luck.’</p>

<p>“This was such a crusher that I did not attempt
to reply, nor, owing to my condition, did I quite
realise the full brutality and injustice of the man
as I might otherwise have done. I crept forward
to my bunk, to find myself shunned by all my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
shipmates as if I was a leper, which treatment, as
I had hitherto been a prime favourite, was very
hard to bear. But in the face of ignorant
superstition like this I was powerless. So I held
my peace and sat solitary, my recovery being
much hindered by the miserable state of my mind.
The rest of the passage to Valparaiso was a time
of such misery as I never experienced before or
since, and I wonder that they did not land a
hopeless lunatic.</p>

<p>“However, I fought against <em>that</em> successfully,
determined to live if I was allowed to, and at
last, to my intense relief, I shook off the dust of
my feet against that detestable ship and her
barbarous crew, thankful that their cruelty had
stopped short of heaving me overboard as a
sacrifice to the <em>manes</em> of my lost shipmates.”</p>

<p>There was a silence of some minutes’ duration
after he had finished his yarn, then from one and
the other came scraps of personalia confirming the
general outlines of his experiences as to the
existence of those nightmares of the sea of incredible
size, as attested by the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ejecta</i> of every
dying cachalot. All gave it as their firm belief
that it must have been a sperm whale that
swallowed Jonah in the long ago, but it was the
general opinion that as a rule a man was perfectly
safe in the water from a sperm whale except under
such circumstances as had been detailed, and that
our friend had been the victim of a mistake on the
part of the hungry leviathan.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRAGICAL TALE OF THE
BOOMERANG PIG</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">He</span> was born under a baleful star. I know,
because I was there at the time. But at the
outset of this veracious history, to prevent probable
misunderstanding, allow me to assert that what
follows in all its details is literally and absolutely
true. Naturally deficient in imagination, I would not
attempt to embellish so curious a narrative as this,
which, were I gifted beyond all literary romancists,
I should only mar by adding fiction thereunto.</p>

<p>Well then, for the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">locus in quo</i>, a lumbering
old Yankee-built ship of some 2000 tons burden,
bound from Liverpool to Bombay with coal, and
at the inauspicious opening of my subject’s erratic
career wallowing in the storm-torn sea off the
Cape of Good Hope. His mother was a middle-aged
lady pig, with a bitter grievance against
mankind in general, and her present owners in
particular. Brought on board during the vessel’s
stay in Madras the previous year, she had never
forgotten or ceased to lament her native jungle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
nor had the long course of gentle treatment and
good food modified by a single vengeful gasp her
virulent hatred of all and sundry. Insult was
added to injury when, in Liverpool, she was
mated with an alien spouse, the chubby pink-flushed
whiteness of whose skin made no greater
contrast to her inky hue than did the calm placidity
of his temper to her furious, unappeasable, and continual
rage. Many tokens of her regard were scored
deeply along his fat sides; indeed, but for the
manifest impossibility of getting a fair bite at him,
it is only reasonable to suppose that she would
have devoured him alive.</p>

<p>Now it befell upon a certain evening, when a
bitter north-east gale was brewing under the
lowering leaden sky, and the weird whistling of
the coming tempest made melancholy music
through the complaining shrouds, that an interesting
event in her history drew near its fulfilment.
In anticipation of this occurrence, our carpenter had
rigged up a rude sort of fold under the top-gallant
forecastle, and within its narrow limits she was
ranging tiger-like, champing her foam-flecked
jaws, and occasionally tobogganing from side to
side in various unhappy attitudes as the ship
tumbled every way in the bewildered sea.
When the watch to which I (a small urchin of
fourteen) belonged came on deck at midnight
I was immediately told off by my inveterate foe,
the second mate, to attend to the requirements of
the “lady in the straw.” Inverted commas are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
necessary, because the “straw” did not exist, nor
any substitute for it; nothing but the bare deck
polished to a glossy slipperiness by the incessant
friction of the sliding sow. There was a fresh
hand at the bellows before we had been on deck
many minutes, and all the watch were soon perched
aloft, struggling short-handedly with the acreage
of thundering canvas, while the ship plunged so
violently that I could only remain under the forecastle
by clinging, bat-like, to the side of the pen
that confined the miserable mother-elect. During
that vigil of terror and darkness (for I had only
one of those ancient teapot-shaped lamps, that
yield more smoking stench than light) eleven
wretched parti-coloured morsels of pork came into
being, the advent of each one exacerbating the
feelings of the already frantic parent to such a
degree that she became a veritable fury, and to my
terrified eyes seemed to dilate with potentialities of
destruction. Out of the whole family I succeeded,
at the imminent risk of my own life, in saving
two from the jaws of their maniacal mother, and
one of those sagaciously succumbed before eight
bells. I received small thanks for my pains, and
narrowly escaped a colting at my tyrant’s hands,
who saw his visions of abundant sucking-pig
rudely dispelled by what he was pleased to call my
“dam’ pig-headed foolishness.”</p>

<p>It boots not now to tell of the wealth of ingenuity
I lavished upon that ill-starred piglet, to whom I
stood perforce <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in loco parentis</i>—how I must needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
lasso the snorting, shrieking mother, and, having
entangled her legs fore and aft, drag her to the
side of the pen and lash her securely down, while
I held my <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protégé</i> to one streaming teat after
another. Enough that the care of that solitary
remnant of a family embittered my days and rendered
my nights sleepless interregnums of weariness.
Unto all things their appointed end, saith the sage,
and so at last I was freed from this porcine incubus
by my charge having grown able and wily enough
to dodge his unnatural parent, and snatch his sustenance
from her in a variety of ingenious ways.
But still he might not trust himself to sleep near
her, and so he discovered a nest beneath the heel of
the bowsprit, whereby her insatiable desire for his
destruction was completely frustrated, since she
could by no possible artifice get at him. After
a while it was noticed that Sûsti (as for some
hidden reason he had come to be called) invariably
wore at the end of his tail a crimson ornament,
which, upon closer examination, was found to be
where something amused itself, or themselves, by
nibbling during the night. The carpenter, who is
always called upon to repair everything on board
ship except ropes and sails, turned to and bound
up the lessening terminal with a piece of tarred
canvas, and plentifully besmeared the outside of
the bandage with tar also. And this he did
many days, because tar, and dressing, and a little
more of Sûsti had always disappeared in the
morning. So the outrage continued, and the tail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
became more and more abbreviated until it was
entirely <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">non est</i>, and the midnight marauders had
actually excavated a socket in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">corpus delicti</i>
nearly half an inch deep.</p>

<p>By this time we had reached Bombay, and were
busy, with the aid of a swarming host of coolies,
in getting rid of our grimy cargo. But some one
found time to suggest that a place of safety for
Sûsti should be found during the night, fearing
that, unless something was done soon, we should
seek him one morning and find only a disembodied
squeal. Consequently Sûsti was captured every
evening, and, protesting discordantly, was confined
in a coal-basket, which was carefully enclosed in
the after hatch house. The plan succeeded
admirably, so far that the diminution in our stock
of pork ceased. But one morning, when the after
hold was empty, the hatch house was lifted off as
usual and placed by the side of the gaping hatchway,
its door open, and Sûsti lying, forgotten, in
his basket. All hands went to breakfast, while
the coolies below, as was their wont, stopped work,
and, squatting in the after-hold, held a conversazione.
In the middle of our meal there was
a hideous uproar, and an eruption of the heathen
from all the hatchways, greenish-grey with fright,
and swarming madly in every possible direction—overboard,
aloft, anywhere. When at last we
were able to elicit from the demented crowd the
reason for their panic, we learned that as they
were all toiling strenuously to prepare the coal for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
a renewal of our operations, down into their midst
came flying a demon of Jehannum in the guise of
a gigantic pig, with vast bat-like wings, and eyes
of the bigness of a man’s fists glaring like red-hot
coals. What wonder that they had fled, Hindoo
and Mussulman alike, at the sight of their
abomination in such an avatar of dread hurtling
down upon their shaven crowns. The story sent
us all seeking below, little dreaming that the luckless
Sûsti was to blame. Presently we found him
lying by the side of the keelson, badly hurt, but
cheerful as ever. And with that indomitable pluck
that had endeared him to us all, he not only survived,
but made a complete recovery within a week.</p>

<p>Now, however, his rotund body had taken a
curve, by reason of which he always appeared to
be in the act of reaching around to look for the
tail that had been. This peculiar bent of his
figure had the strangest results whenever he took
exercise. Wherever his goal might be, and in
spite of his most energetic efforts to reach it, he
only succeeded in describing what I am obliged to
call a lateral parabola, along which he would
eventually arrive at some unforeseen spot near his
starting-point. Nor were the co-efficients of his
curves at all regular. Sometimes, owing to the
energetic efforts he made to counteract this inevitable
curvilinear bias, a series of maxima and
minima were produced which, when traced upon
the deck, afforded some very interesting problems
in the parallelograms of forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p>But I regret to record that the principal
result of his errata was a decided increase in the
local consumption of Scotch whisky. For our
jovial skipper became so inordinately vain of his
boomerang pig that he issued invitations to his
fellow-captains in the harbour, in quite a reckless
fashion, to come and see what an unprecedented
curio he had gotten. They came multitudinously,
came to scoff, but remained to grow purple with
laughter and lose all their loose change in bets
upon the probable points of arrival made by Sûsti
in his gyratory gallops after sweet biscuits. And
they returned to their several ships in a charming
variety of unconventional attitudes, vocal but not
harmonious, at irregular intervals during the night.
Meanwhile Sûsti, pampered beyond even swinish
dreams of avarice, waxed fat and almost uncontrollable.
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Joie de vivre</i> filled him from end to end—from
snout to socket. It seized him suddenly at
all sorts of times, causing him to squeal hysterically,
waggle his incipient hams momentarily, and then
launch himself into space along the line of some
marvellously complicated curve terminating in the
most unexpected places.</p>

<p>As long as Europeans were about him he was
safe, except for an occasional belabouring when he
chanced to upset some luckless passer-by. But we
were ordered round the coast to Cocanada in ballast,
and, to expedite our loading there, took a number
of coolies with us. On the day of our arrival,
and shortly after anchoring, all hands were seated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
peacefully at dinner on the forecastle head.
Below, on the shady side of the forward house, the
“bundaree” had prepared the coolies’ meal, an
immense flat dish of rice piled into a cone, with
a number of tiny wells of curry round the rim,
and a larger reservoir of the same fiery compound
at the apex in a sort of crater. Around this the
placid Hindoos crouched on their hams in orthodox
fashion, and each right hand had just begun to
manipulate a bolus of curry-moistened rice for
conveyance to the expectant mouths, when with a
meteoric rush Sûsti came round the corner of the
house in a grand ellipse, and landed in the centre
of the rice-pan. This was too much for even
those mild coolies. With yells and imprecations
they sprang for handspikes, belaying-pins, etc.,
and rushed upon the unclean beast, perfectly mad
with rage. Our big retriever, who hated all black
men impartially, and was therefore rigidly limited
to the poop as a rule, saw the melée, and, judging
doubtless that it was high time for his interference,
came flying from his eminence, all shining teeth
and savage snarl, into the centre of the struggling
mass. For a brief moment nothing could be
clearly distinguished; then suddenly there was a
break up and a stampede. Every coolie sprang
overboard like the demon-possessed swine of
Gadara, leaving Neptune sadly sniffing at the
lifeless body of Sûsti, which lay embedded in a
heap of the befouled and scattered rice.</p>

<span class="subhead">A DAY ON THE SOLANDER
WHALING-GROUND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">A bright</span> sunny morning; the gentle north-easterly
breeze just keeping the sails full as the
lumbering whaling-barque <i>Splendid</i> dips jerkily
to the old southerly swell. Astern, the blue hills
around Preservation Inlet lie shimmering in the
soft spring sunlight, and on the port beam the
mighty pillar of the Solander Rock, lying off the
south-western extremity of New Zealand, is
sharply outlined against the steel-blue sky. Far
beyond that stern sentinel, the converging shores
of Foveaux Strait are just discernible in dim
outline through a low haze. Ahead, the jagged
and formidable rocks of Stewart Island, bathed in
a mellow golden glow, give no hint of their
terrible appearance what time the Storm-fiend of
the south-west cries havoc and urges on his
chariot of war.</p>

<p>The keen-eyed Kanaka in the fore crow’s nest
shades his eyes with his hand, peering earnestly
out on the weather bow at something which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
attracted his attention. A tiny plume of vapour
rises from the blue hollows about ten miles away,
but so faint and indefinable that it may be only
a breaking wavelet’s crest caught by the cross
wind. Again that little bushy jet breaks the
monotony of the sea; but this time there is
no mistaking it. Emerging diagonally from the
water, not high and thin, but low and spreading,
it is an infallible indication to those piercing eyes
of the presence of a sperm-whale. The watcher
utters a long, low musical cry, “Blo-o-o-o-w,”
which penetrates the gloomy recesses of fo’ksle
and cuddy, where the slumberers immediately
engage in fierce conflict with whales of a size
never seen by waking eyes. The officer and
white seamen at the main now take up the cry,
and in a few seconds all hands are swiftly yet
silently preparing to leave the ship. She is put
about, making a course which shortly brings her
a mile or two to windward of the slowly-moving
cachalot. Now it is evident that no solitary
whale is in sight, but a great school, gambolling
in the bright spray. One occasionally, in pure
exuberance of its tremendous vitality, springs
twenty feet into the clear air, and falls, a hundred
tons of massive flesh, with earthquake-like commotion,
back into the sea.</p>

<p>Having got the weather-gage, the boats are
lowered; sail is immediately set, and, like swift
huge-winged birds, they swoop down upon the
prey. Driving right upon the back of the nearest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
monster, two harpoons are plunged into his body
up to the “hitches.” The sheet is at once hauled
aft, and the boat flies up into the wind; while the
terrified cetacean vainly tries, by tremendous
writhing and plunging, to rid himself of the
barbed weapon. The mast is unshipped, and
snugly stowed away; oars are handled, and
preparation made to deliver the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de grâce</i>.
But finding his efforts futile, the whale has
sounded, and his reappearance must be awaited.
Two boats’ lines are taken out before the slackening
comes, and he slowly rises again. Faster and
faster the line comes in; the blue depths turn a
creamy white, and it is “Stern all,” for dear life.
Up he comes, with jaws gaping twenty feet wide,
gleaming teeth and livid, cavernous throat glittering
in the brilliant light. But the boat’s crew are
seasoned hands, to whom this dread sight is
familiar, and orders are quietly obeyed, the boat
backing, circling and darting ahead like a sentient
thing under their united efforts. So the infuriated
mammal is baffled and dodged, while thrust after
thrust of the long lances are got home, and
streamlets of blood trickling over the edges of
his spout-hole give warning that the end is near.
A few wild circlings at tremendous speed, jaws
clashing and blood foaming in torrents from the
spiracle, one mighty leap into the air, and the
ocean monarch is dead. He lies just awash,
gently undulated by the long, low swell, one
pectoral fin slowly waving like some great stray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
leaf of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Fucus gigantea</i>. A hole is cut through
the fluke and the line secured to it. The ship,
which has been working to windward during the
conflict, runs down and receives the line; and in
a short time the great inert mass is hauled alongside
and secured by the fluke chain.</p>

<p>The other two boats have succeeded in killing
a large fish also, but are at least four miles off.
They may as well try to move the Solander itself
as tow their unwieldy prize to the ship. The
shapeless bulk of the cachalot makes it a difficult
tow at all times, but, with a rising wind and sea,
utterly impossible to whale-boats. The barometer
is falling; great masses of purple-edged cumuli
are piling high on the southern horizon, and no
weather prophet is needed to foretell the imminent
approach of a heavy gale. The captain looks
wistfully to windward at Preservation Inlet, only
twenty-five miles off, and thinks, with fierce
discontent, of the prize, worth eight or nine
hundred pounds, which lies but four or five miles
away, and must be abandoned solely for want of
steam-power. And that is not all. Around, far
as the eye can reach, the bushy spouts are rising.
Hundreds of gigantic cetaceans are disporting,
apparently not at all “gallied” by the conflict which
has been going on. Some are near enough to the
fast boat to be touched by hand. “Potentialities
of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice” are here;
but acquisition is impossible for want of steam.
The vessel, bound to that immense body, can only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
crawl tortoise-like before the wind—lucky, indeed,
to have a harbour ahead where the whale may
be cut in, even though it be forty miles away.
Without that refuge available, she could not hope
to keep the sea and hold her prize through the
wild weather, now so near. So, with a heavy
heart, the captain orders the fast boat to abandon
her whale and return with all possible speed. The
breeze is freshening fast, and all sail is made for
Port William. So slow is the progress, that it is
past midnight before that snug shelter is reached,
although for the last four hours the old ship is
terribly tried and strained by the press of sail
carried to such a gale.</p>

<p>In four days the work of getting the oil is
finished, and three or four Maoris ashore have
made a tun and a half of good clear oil from the
abandoned carcass. This, added to the ship’s
quantity, makes twelve and a half tuns of oil and
spermaceti mingled from the one fish. None
smaller has been noticed out of the hundreds
seen on the same day. It is eighteen days from
the time of anchoring before the harbour can
again be quitted, owing to adverse winds and
gales. Who can estimate the number of opportunities
lost in that time? On the second day
after reaching the grounds, another school is seen
with the same result—one fish, and another fortnight’s
enforced idleness.</p>

<p>This is no imaginary sketch, but a faithful
record of actual facts, which, with slight variations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
has been repeated many times within the writer’s
experience. On one occasion there were four of
us on the ground in company—three Americans,
and one colonial. Each secured a whale before
dusk. We kept away at once for Port William,
fearing the shifting of the wind, which would
bring us on a ragged, lee shore. The Americans,
being strangers to the coast, hauled off to the
westward. Five days afterwards, as we were
cleaning ship after trying out, those three ships
came creeping in to the harbour through the
eastern end of Foveaux Strait, all sadly damaged,
and of course whaleless. They had been battered
by the furious gale all that time, and barely
escaped destruction on the Snares. Two of them
left the grounds a few days after, having had their
fill of the Solander. Thus, it is obvious that
nothing but steam is needed to make this
most prolific of whaling-grounds a veritable
treasure-field. Cutting in and trying out at sea
could be entirely dispensed with. The magnificent
land-locked harbour of Preservation Inlet, to say
nothing of others easily available, affords complete
facilities for a shore station. The water is in
many cases forty or fifty fathoms deep alongside
the rocks, while sheltered nooks abound, “where
never wind blows loudly.”</p>

<p>Working by the share, no finer or more skilful
whalemen exist than the half-breed Maoris who
people Stewart Island, and they would joyfully welcome
such a grand opportunity of making their pile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>Long before the Antarctic Expedition from
Dundee left our shores, the merits of this grand
field for whaling operations were discussed at
length by the writer in the columns of a Dundee
paper, and strongly advocated; but those responsible
for the management of that venture were
evidently so wedded to Greenland methods that
the advice was unheeded. Perhaps the unprofitable
issue of the enterprise as far as whales were
concerned may dispose the adventurers to take
advice, and try sperm-whaling in the temperate
zone, in place of right-whaling in the far south.
Should they do so, there is every reason to hope
and believe that the palmy days of the sperm-whale
fishery may be renewed. Dundee firms of
to-day may then, like Messrs. Enderby of London
in 1820–30, gladly welcome home ship after ship,
full to the hatches with the valuable spoil of the
Southern Seas.</p>

<span class="subhead">SEA-ELEPHANTS AT HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Judging</span> by the popularity of the seals at the
Zoological Gardens, these wonderful amphibia
have a firm hold upon the affections of ordinary
people. It probably occurs to but few as they
gaze delightedly upon the unapproachable grace
of the seals in their favourite element, how brutal
and debasing is the pursuit of them for commercial
purposes. This is a theme that has
exercised the powers of many able writers, but has
probably never been set forth in such awful realism
as Mr. Burn-Murdoch has presented us with
in his book, <cite>From Edinburgh to the Antarctic</cite>.
For the seal is such a gentle, kindly creature, so
perfectly harmless, except perhaps during the courting
season, when the males fight fiercely, but never
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à l’outrance</i>. The seal’s one mistake in life is that
he has not exerted the intelligence that he undoubtedly
possesses in the direction of clothing
himself with some substitute, worthless to man,
for the inimitable covering which is so ardently
craved by shivering man and womankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>There are, however, some seals that, from their
bulk and ferocious appearance, actually invite
attack from those ardent sportsmen who only
long for sight of game worthy of hunting. The
sea-elephant (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Macrorhinus proboscideus</i>), upon
first acquaintance, seems, as our transatlantic
friends concisely express it, “to fill the bill,” in
these respects. In size he is little inferior to the
huge quadruped after which he has been named,
although, owing to the absence of legs, he will
not look so bulky as the elephant. The possession
of a rudimentary trunk of a foot or so
in length has probably had little to do with the
trivial appellation given to this great Phoca, his
enormous size as compared with the ordinary
seal being warrant enough for the name. Since
the sea-elephant’s hide is almost hairless, only the
massive coating of blubber he carries can excite
the cupidity of the hunter, and then only in the
absence of anything that may be easier obtained.</p>

<p>During the course of a whaling voyage “down
South” it was the writer’s misfortune to visit the
Auckland Islands in search of sea-elephants, owing
to the unaccountable absence of whales from the
vicinity for an extraordinarily long time. No one
of the ship’s company had ever seen one of the
creatures before, although most were well acquainted
with ordinary seal-hunting. When,
therefore, it was decided to visit the lonely, storm-tormented
isles usually frequented by them there
was an utter absence of enthusiasm. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
many openly expressed a strong desire to be well
out of the business. But when once a course has
been decided upon at sea it needs stronger
measures and greater unanimity among the crew
than is often possessed to alter it, and consequently,
after a truly miserable time of
contention with the inhospitality of the Southern
Ocean, we found ourselves anchored in a fairly
well-sheltered bay at the Aucklands. The time
of our visit was the antipodean spring, a season
which, in those latitudes, is rigorous beyond belief.
Gales of wind, accompanied by hard snowflakes
and hail, raged almost incessantly, enwrapping the
entire land surface in a bleak haze of spray from
the sea, mingled with the congealed moisture from
above. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the
object of the expedition had to be pursued without
delay, parties were landed, armed with clubs
of iron-wood, short but massive, and long, keen
knives. General instructions were given as to
procedure, based upon insufficient data, as the
recipients well knew, and therefore not at all
reliable. Everybody understood in a hazy sort of
way that a seal’s vulnerable point was his nose:
a tap on that was as paralysing as a bullet through
the heart. Of course. And the subsequent proceedings
were merely a matter of practice and
stamina. <em>Very</em> good—oh, very good indeed!
Thus equipped the explorers went blundering over
boulders, wading through morasses, over fallen
tree-trunks and glassy ice-slopes, until suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
through the mist loomed up a massy shape. Possibly
it was exaggerated by the haze, but it looked
truly terrific when it was seen to be alive. It was
surprising how little any one coveted the honour
of being first to attack the big seal in front of
them. But for very shame’s sake there could be
no halting on the sealers’ part.</p>

<p>An appalling roar, quite in keeping with his
appearance, burst from the monster, at which a
most sympathetic thrill ran through the attacking
party, accompanied by an earnest desire to be
somewhere else. Again that indefinite desire to
stand well in each other’s opinion came to their
rescue, impelling the foremost man to fling his
fears to the winds and rush in upon the formidable
beast crouching before him. A badly-aimed blow
at the animal’s snout made no more impression
than a snow-flake, but the unwieldy creature,
thoroughly alarmed, dropped from his semi-rampant
altitude, almost burying his daring
assailant beneath him as he did so. Then, like
some legless hippopotamus, he waddled seawards,
rolling from side to side in a manner so utterly
ludicrous that fear was totally quenched in an
uproarious burst of laughter. Recovering from
that revulsionary paroxysm, all hands rushed upon
the retreating mass, each eager to be the first to
attack what we now saw to be a thoroughly
demoralised foe.</p>

<p>Out of the many harmless blows aimed at the
great seal’s head one struck the root of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
proboscis, and like some vast bladder suddenly
deflated he sank to the ground. Into the subsequent
details it is not edifying to enter, their
crude brutality being only excusable on the
ground of nervous ignorance. But as foolhardiness
succeeded timorousness, so did tragedy wait
upon comedy. Out of the mist-enwrapped morass
to shoreward of us came in elephantine haste a
perfect host of the huge creatures we were seeking.
And, as if they could not see us or were so
terror-stricken that nothing could hinder them in
their extraordinary career seawards, they came
floundering, bellowing right amongst our little
party. For one short minute it seemed as if
we should be overwhelmed, crushed under this
mountainous charge of massive flesh. Then there
was “sauve qui peut.” In various directions we
fled from the path of the advancing hosts, but
hung upon their flanks, getting a straggler now
and then. The chase grew frantic, “thorough bog,
thorough briar,” over rocks and through streams;
panting with fierce desire to slay, and forgetful of
all else. What a crowd of savages we were!</p>

<p>At the last moment, on the very edge of the
beach, one of our number, anxious to get just another
victim, missed his blow, and stumbled right upon the
huge beast. Putting out his arms to save himself,
he thrust one of them right into the mouth of the
gaping behemoth. An ear-splitting yell of agony
followed, bringing every man to his assistance on
the gallop. At first it was difficult to see what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
had happened, the great bulk of the seal as it
swayed from side to side effectually hiding the
puny form of the suffering enemy by its side. He,
poor wretch, was in evil case; for the sea-elephant
has the alarming habit of crushing solid
pebbles of basalt or granite as large as oranges
between his jaws in much the same fashion as a
healthy youngster does lollypops. Probably this
strange exercise of the gigantic jaw power he
possesses is rendered necessary for digestive purposes,
since no seal masticates its food.</p>

<p>Poor Sandy, who in such headlong fashion had
thrust his arm into that awful mill, now found to
his bitter cost what use might be made of the
generally harmless stonebreakers. After the first
blood-curdling scream we had heard there was an
utter silence as far as our shipmate was concerned,
only the soft floundering of the immense mass of
sliding flesh and the snorting breath being audible.
The mate was the first to realise what had
happened, and with a howl of anger he leaped
forward, bringing down his club with all his might
just as the creature stooped low for another launching
movement seaward. The blow fell just at the
junction of the proboscis with the skull, and with
a shudder which convulsed the whole mass of his
body the huge animal collapsed, burying our unhappy
shipmate beneath him. With one impulse
we all sprang upon the heap of flesh, tearing with
desperate energy to roll it from off the body, but
it really seemed at first impossible to move it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
Slipping, sliding, gasping for breath, we all
pushed and strove—wasting, I doubt not, more than
half our strength for want of preconcerted action.
Oh, joy; we moved him at last, and there lay
Sandy to all appearance a corpse.</p>

<p>Without any further delay we placed him in the
boat, hoping that he was still alive, but by no
means sure, and with all possible speed he was
taken on board. This sudden calamity seemed
to paralyse the rest of us for the time, and we all
stood about watching the departing boat, as if we
could not make up our minds to resume operations.
But suddenly a dull, thunderous roar startled us
from our lethargy, and looking landwards through
the driving sleet we saw the shapeless forms of
another immense herd of the ungainly monsters
floundering toward us. Manifestly we were in an
unhealthy predicament, and without waiting for
orders we fled in all directions but towards the
advancing herd. Through swampy patches of
green, over frozen rocks, torn by thorny shrubs,
and incessantly dodging the blind onset of groups
of the wallowing monsters, we scrambled unreasoningly
until—panting, breathless, and demoralized—we
halted from sheer inability to go farther.
When we had recovered it was some time before
we got together again, and when we did we were
a sorry crowd, as unfit as could well be imagined
for the tremendous labour that awaited us of
skinning the huge carcasses that lay dotted about
the foreshore. However, we commenced the task,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
and by nightfall had completed the flenching.
A gun from the ship recalled us on board almost
too weary to launch the boats, and plastered thickly
with mud, blood, and grease. When we arrived
on board we were too exhausted to eat, hardly able
to feel any interest in the news that Sandy was
alive and doing as well as could be expected. But
one conviction was burnt deep into the perceptions
of all—that the hardest whaling ever done was a
pleasant pastime compared with sea-elephant hunting
at the Aucklands.</p>

<span class="subhead">AN INTERVIEW</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Difficulties,</span> which, could I have foreseen then,
would have appeared insurmountable, attended
the interview hereinafter recorded. First of all,
His Majesty King Cachalot the MMCC was not
in the best of humours—which was hardly to be
wondered at, since, with all the ability we could
muster, five boats’ crews of us from the spouter
<i>Finback</i> had been harassing him since daylight,
eager to add his fourteen-ton overcoat to our
greasy cargo. It was a blazing day on the Line,
Pacific side, with hardly a ripple on the water, so
that what advantage there was weighed on our
side. Yet so wary and skilful had his Majesty
proved, that one by one the boats had retired hurt
from the field, while the object of their attentions
was as fresh as paint, and, as he afterwards expressed
it, “going very strong.” Nevertheless the scrum
had been warm in a double sense, and his Majesty
bore many palpable evidences of our efforts all
over his huge black body.</p>

<p>Being in command of the only surviving boat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
sole representative of our available force, and
with a reputation yet to win, I must confess to a
little lack of care, a nervous desire to distinguish
myself; but I still think it was hard to have
my boat knocked into a litter of barrel staves
by the unanticipated somersault of my expected
prize just as I reckoned upon delivering
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de lance</i> in final settlement of our little
account.</p>

<p>After the surprise of our meeting had somewhat
subsided, I found myself reclining in a richly
carved and upholstered chair in my genial host’s
splendidly furnished reception room, puffing with
appreciative enjoyment at one of his unapproachable
Rothschilds—’beg pardon I’m sure—I mean that I
found myself clinging with no uncertain clutch to
a capsized line-tub, into which I succeeded in
getting after a series of involuntary evolutions,
after having managed to swallow the majority of
a barrel of salt water. While settling myself in
my ark like a faded Moses, our late antagonist
drew near and watched me closely. As soon as I
appeared to be <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">compos mentis</i>, he thus addressed
me:</p>

<p>“What you settin’ there fur a-gappin’ at <em>me</em>
’sif y’didn’t know who I wuz.”</p>

<p>“I humbly beg your Majesty’s pardon; I meant
no offence, I assure you. But I perceive you are
an American citizen.”</p>

<p>“Perseev’ nothin’, y’abbrevyated galoot,”
growled he. “Hain’t enny persepshun ’baout ye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
’r y’ewd see I’m waitin’ ter be interviewed, same’s
all th’ other sellebritiz.”</p>

<p>Now, although I <em>do</em> believe that the journalist is
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nascitur, non fit</i>, my nascent journalism if existent
was decidedly latent, and at present I was indubitably
unfit for anything but a rescue or two. But here
was a unique chance of becoming famous, and
though modest and retiring to the last degree, I
rose to the occasion. A few fragmentary recollections
marshalled themselves, and I asked
insinuatingly:</p>

<p>“How old is your Majesty?”</p>

<p>“One thousan’ four hunderd seasons,” he replied
promptly.</p>

<p>As soon as I recovered my breath, I answered
politely, “Indeed! Your Majesty wears well. I
should hardly have thought it. Are your Majesty’s
parents living?”</p>

<p>“How’d I know,” he grumbled, peeping
fiercely at me out of the corner of his starboard
eye. “Don’t go much on parients ermong our
peepul. Next please!”</p>

<p>“Where did your venerability do us the honour
to be born, if the question be allowable?” I queried
timidly.</p>

<p>“Here,” he roared, with a resounding crash of
his enormous tail on the surface; “where’d ye think
I’d be born but at sea?”</p>

<p>Deficient in locality evidently, I thought, being
a bit of a phrenologist myself, though it would
have required a theodolite to survey the bumps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
upon <em>his</em> capacious cranium. But as he showed
signs of irritability, I added quickly, “Are you
married, your Majesty, or how?”</p>

<p>“Well; I should cackle,” he said—“married, hay!
Why one of your (an awful reverberation suggested
a powerful adjective) slush-tubs hez jest broke up
one uv the purtiest little harems I ever collected,
twelve ravishin’ beauties sech ez any monark’d be

erwun. He’s usin’ roun’ the Bonins ’baout now, ’n’
I mus’ git over thar ’n’ b’reave him. Royal rights,
y’know,” and his Majesty shed a ponderous wink.</p>

<p>“What does your Majesty do for a living?” I
ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>“Eat!” he roared. “Harpoons en bomb-guns,
what dz ennybody du fr a livin’? <em>I</em> never heerd
sech a barnacle-headed grampus ’n all my fishin’.”
With that he lifted up his tremendous caput out of
water and exposed his Blackwall tunnel of a mouth,
as who should remark, “Not much room for
other occupation in a whale’s life when a gulf like
this needs attention.”</p>

<p>I suppose I looked a bit preoccupied, for he
hastily added, “But I never eat sech insecks ez you
be.”</p>

<p>“What, never?” I ventured to murmur.</p>

<p>“No, never,” he replied; “at least, that is,”—but
seeing his hesitation, I said I fancied I’d heard
a story about a passenger by the name of Jonah
down on the Syrian coast a while back. “Oh, well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
y’know,” he muttered apologetically, “’f course
accidents will happen, ’s the shark said to his
brother when he took him in, but I don’t reckon
thar wuz anythin’ to mek a noise erbout. ’Tany-rate
the can’date left considerable sudden. Yew
needn’t be ’fraid ennyhow.”</p>

<p>But I was unprepared with any more questions
at the moment, the outlook, or inlook rather, being
so disconcerting. So I said, “Would your Majesty
object to outlining a few of your wonderful experiences
for the benefit of landsmen generally.
Any information you may choose to give will be
regarded as strictly confidential, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sartinly,” he replied with an alarming
area of smile. “Mos’ ov ’em hev ben with your
dod-gasted tribe. Why yew’re tarnally prowlin’
erbout tryin’ ter get ter wind’ard ov peac’ble
fokes I kaint surmise. Still, up till now I’ve ben
equal ter holdin’ me own,—keepin’ me eend up, ez
yew may say. To-day f’rinstance, hey?” I winced
under the sarcasm. “But I mind onst daown on
the Noo Seelan’ coas’ towin’ five boat-load ov
Mowries frum the Solander ’way down eenamost
ter the Cambells. They wuz a plucky crowd, f’r
they helt on ter me through a blizzard ov hail an’
snow lasting twyst az long as I kin stay soundin’.
When it gin over they wuz all fruz stiffer’n a

I wuz pretty fat in those days, so their all-fired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>

free.</p>

<p>“Then a left-handed-on-both-feet crowd eout ov
a French right-whaler tackled me offn the Cape.
Mighty big mistake <em>they</em> struck—thought I wuz

reck’nin’ ter let her go et that.</p>

<p>“Say, djever see er big squid, big’s me?” he
queried sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, your Majesty, I did once. Only once.
B-b-b-ay of B-b-bengal,” for I was almost moribund.</p>

<p>“Ah, you <em>hev</em> seen suthin’ then. F’r yew
insecks wut live on top don’t offen git a chance
ter see them critters ’less we bring ’em up f’r the

added impressively, “I’ll be weather-bound ef he

<p>“Did I ever have enny fights with me own
people? Well I—but there, how’d yew know,
poor thing. Millyuns ov ’em. Look at me,”
and he swept proudly past exhibiting his grooved
and ribbed flanks bearing indelible traces of many
a furious battle, some of the foot-wide scars being
twenty feet long.</p>

<p>“Enny more informashun I c’n supply yew

<p>Happy thought, “What do you live on mostly,

<p>“Squid. Fust ’n las’ ’n’ between meals gen’ly.

<p>I was alone. There was nothing in sight, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
my interviewee was gone. So stiff and sore was I
that I could hardly turn my head to see if help
was coming. There was no help in sight that I
could discover, but presently a boat came along
from the ship and picked me up—none too soon.
Gloomily we returned on board to moralise
mournfully over our ill-luck and the perfidy of
sperm whales generally.</p>

<span class="subhead">UP A WATERSPOUT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Of</span> course no one is under any obligation to
believe this most reliable relation. At the same
time I may be allowed to remind the sceptical
that in the present case their credibility is subjected
to no such strain as half the respectable advertisements
of the day place upon it. However, I
won’t press the point; here is the story, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fay ce que
vouldras</i>.</p>

<p>Doubtless you have all heard of waterspouts,
many of you have seen them in full spin, and not
a few, amateurs of meteorology, have got their
pet theories as to the genesis, evolution, and
dissolution of these mysterious meteors. With
just a touch of perhaps pardonable vanity I may
say that, for an important section of society, my
theory holds the field—is, in fact, unassailable.
But I refrain from exposing it publicly at present,
principally because such exposition involves a large
use of the higher mathematics, in which I am, to
be candid, somewhat shaky; and secondly, because
the editor would see me farther before he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
let me do it. But an ounce of experience is
worth a ton of theory, even such gilt-edged theory
as mine—at least most of us work on the lines of
this well-worn proverb. So my experience, which
is herein set forth, must necessarily be considered
as the most valuable contribution to our knowledge
of waterspoutery or trombe-oonery that has ever
yet appeared. I might claim more for it than
this, but modesty was ever a failing of mine.</p>

<p>On 23rd August last, then, I was leaning over
the taffrail of an ancient barque, of which I was
“only” mate, homeward bound from Iquique to
Falmouth for orders. We had reached the horse
latitudes, those detestable regions embracing the
debatable area between the limits of the north-east
and south-east trade winds. Here you may have
such an exhibition of what the skies are capable of
in the matter of rain as nowhere else in the world.
For days together the weather will consist of
squalls—not much wind in them as a rule—from
all points of the compass, but rain—well, one
might almost as well be living beneath an ocean
of which the bottom is given to falling out
occasionally. And as all this tremendous rainfall
comes from the sea, the replenishment of the
supply upstairs keeps the pumping machinery
going constantly. It is no uncommon sight to
see forty or fifty waterspouts in various stages
of their career at one time. On this particular
afternoon there was quite a forest of them about,
but as yet none of them had come within less than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
two or three miles of the ship. It was my watch
below, and the air being stifling down in the
murky little cabin, I was enjoying a pipe and a
little cool breeze that had been blowing for about
twenty minutes in the right direction. The old
hooker was wriggling along about two or three
knots—sufficiently fast to induce me to try
whether some members of a sociable school of
dolphins that were playing about us could be
gulled into biting at a bit of white rag I was trailing,
which concealed a formidable hook. The “old
man” was below, seated at the cabin table,
wrestling with his day’s reckoning not over-successfully,
for his grumbling expletives were
now and then audible through the wide-open
skylight, the man at the wheel gazing skyward
with a comical expression of innocence whenever
he met my eye after an extra heavy blast from
below. The antics of the fish beneath me so
fully occupied my attention that the near approach
of a waterspout along the starboard beam did not
attract my notice. In any case, the weather was
no affair of mine, the bo’sun being in charge,
though, as usual in these undermanned vessels,
up to his elbows in tar, away forward somewhere.
But suddenly the gloom became so heavy and the
chill in the air so evident, that I looked up wondering
whence the squall had arrived at such short
notice. At that moment a big dolphin who had
been tantalising me for a long time seized my
hook. I had only two or three fathoms of line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
out, and being balanced upon the taffrail, the jerk
was sufficiently forceful to make me turn a back
somersault overboard. The last thing I saw was
the helmsman’s face blank with utter amazement
at my sudden exit. I struck the water end-on,
going pretty deep, but on returning to the surface
was horrified to find myself the centre of a
whirling, seething commotion, as if some unseen
giant was stirring the sea with a mighty spoon.
The gyrations I was compelled to perform made
me quite giddy and sick, although my head kept
so well above water that I was in no danger of
drowning. Faster and faster yet I was whirled
around, while a dense fog seemed to rise all
round, shutting out everything from view behind
an impenetrable white curtain.</p>

<p>I have often noticed that if you tuck a chicken’s
head under its wing and give it a gentle circular
motion it will “stay put,” in any position you
like for an indefinite length of time, although the
brightness of its eyes and its regular respiration
shows that it is “all there.” Thus it was with
me. I was certainly all there, but the spinning
business had reduced me to a hypnotised or
mesmerised condition, in which I was incapable of
independent volition, while keenly conscious of
all that was going on. I became aware of an
upward movement, a sort of spiral ascension, as if
I was attached to one of the threads of a gigantic
vertical screw that was being withdrawn by a steady
left-handed revolution. Also, it was very wet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
though not with a solid wetness as of the sea—more
like one of the usual tremendous showers
we had lately been having, and in no sense was I
conscious of floating. I began to get somewhat
used to the spiral movement, the sensation being
almost pleasant, since the nausea that troubled me
was gone, but I wondered vaguely whither I was
bound. It was getting very cold, and a muffled
persistent roar, as of some infuriated bull uttering
his grievances through a vast speaking-trumpet,
worried me greatly, for I could imagine no reason
for such a sound. However, in my passive
condition I could only endure whatever came
along, this being no time for protest or struggle.</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt myself emerge as if from a pipe
up into an immense reservoir of the heaviest mist
I ever felt. At that instant a terrible sensation of
instability took possession of me, very like that one
experiences in wandering over deep new-fallen
snow, concealing Heaven knows what crevasses
beneath, only more so. My heart worked like a
pulsometer, and every nerve in my quivering
corpus said as plain as print, “You’ll come an
awful cropper directly.” And it was even so.
All my lost power of independent movement came
back to me at once, and frantically clutching at
the fog wreaths around me I began to fall. Most
of us know that ugly old dream where the bed
plays see-saw over some unfathomable abyss,
higher at every swing, till suddenly we wake
snatching at the bed-clothes and bathed in sweat. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
my case, unfortunately, the fall came too. It
seemed to occupy hours. While I came hurtling
from the heavens I remembered with satisfaction
that the wife would get her half-pay right up to
the end of the voyage, and I fervently hoped she
had kept my insurance premiums paid up. Then
the great solemn sea sprang up to meet me. There
was a Number One splash, a rush of salt water in my
ears, and the blessed daylight once more. Right
close to me was the ship, all hands gaping over the
side at me as if I was a spook and never a one
offering to heave me a line. The manner of my
reappearance seemed to have knocked them all silly.
All except the old man, that is. He stooped
deliberately, picked up the coil of the main topsail
brace, and hove it at me. It fell all about me in a
tangle, but I managed to get hold of the standing
part, which I froze to tight, while the skipper
hauled me alongside. Feeling numb and stupid,
I yet managed to haul myself on board, and with
all the chaps gaping at me with protruding eyes,
staggered up on to the poop. The skipper met
me with a scowl, saying grimly, “Looky here, Mr.
Brown, the next time you quit this ship, with my
leave or without, you’ll stay there.” I felt hurt,
but disinclined to talk back, so I went below to
change my dunnage and enter up my log-book.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
